This wasn't an attractive thing for your users to see, and could also result in performance issues due to the repainting required after each image loads, hence adding the attributes being a good idea.</p>\n<p>Let’s move forward a few years to the era of responsive design. To keep images from breaking out of their containers when the container becomes narrower than the image, developers started using CSS like the following:</p>\n<div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: css notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token selector\">img</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">max-width</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> 100%<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">height</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> auto<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This is really useful for responsive layouts, but unfortunately it causes the jank problem to return — the above CSS overrides the width and height attribute information, meaning that if the image has not loaded for some reason, its height will be set to 0. When the image finally loads, the same jank will occur as the page layout is shifted to make space for it.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"a_new_way_of_sizing_images_before_loading_completes","title":"A new way of sizing images before loading completes","isH3":false,"content":"<p>Recognizing the problem, a WICG community group formed to propose an <a href=\"https://github.com/WICG/intrinsicsize-attribute\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\"><code>intrinsicsize</code></a> attribute. Folks from Mozilla then expanded on this thinking, working on a proposal in the CSS <a href=\"https://drafts.csswg.org/css-sizing-4/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Box Sizing Level 4</a> draft to define an <code>aspect-ratio</code> property and propose the idea of using the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes to compute layout. Fantasai &amp; Jen Simmons collaborated with Emilio, who worked on an experimental implementation to prove it would work.</p>\n<p>Mozilla then <a href=\"https://github.com/WICG/intrinsicsize-attribute/issues/16\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">brought the idea up in the WICG community group</a> and discussed it further until representatives from Chrome were onboard with the idea.</p>\n<p>Due to this work, browsers are working on adding a new mechanism for sizing images before the actual image is loaded. Firefox has added an internal <code>aspect-ratio</code> property (in version 69 onwards) that applies to replaced elements, and other related elements that accept <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes. This appears in the browser's internal UA stylesheet, similar to the following:</p>\n<div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: css notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token selector\">img, input[type=\"image\"], video, embed, iframe, marquee, object, table</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">aspect-ratio</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token function\">attr</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>width<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> / <span class=\"token function\">attr</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>height<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This actually affects any element that acts as a container for complex or mixed visual media — <a href=\"/ja/docs/Web/HTML/Element/embed\"><code>&lt;embed&gt;</code></a>, <a href=\"/ja/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe\"><code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code></a>, <a href=\"/ja/docs/Web/HTML/Element/marquee\"><code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code></a>, <a href=\"/ja/docs/Web/HTML/Element/object\"><code>&lt;object&gt;</code></a>, <a href=\"/ja/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table\"><code>&lt;table&gt;</code></a>, and <a href=\"/ja/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video\"><code>&lt;video&gt;</code></a>, in addition to actual images (<a href=\"/ja/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img\"><code>&lt;img&gt;</code></a> and <code>&lt;input type=\"image\"&gt;</code>). When such an element has <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes set on it, its aspect ratio will be calculated before load time, and be available to the browser.</p>\n<div class=\"notecard note\" id=\"sect1\">\n  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Currently this effect is being limited to actual <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> elements, as applying to other such elements may have undesirable results.
