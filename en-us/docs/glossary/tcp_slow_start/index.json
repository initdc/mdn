The slow start threshold (<em>ssthresh</em>) determines the (de)activation of slow start. When a new connection is made, cwnd is initialized to one TCP data or acknowledgment packet, and waits for an acknowledgement, or ACK.

The server sends data in TCP packets, the user's client then confirms delivery by returning acknowledgements, or ACKs. The connection has a limited capacity depending on hardware and network conditions. If the server sends too many packets too quickly, they will be dropped. Meaning, there will be no acknowledgement. The server registers this as missing ACKs. Congestion control algorithms use this flow of sent packets and ACKs to determine a send rate.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"see_also","title":"See also","isH3":false,"content":"<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/How_browsers_work\">Populating the page: how browsers work</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview\">http overview</a></li>\n</ul>"}}],"toc":[{"text":"Congestion control","id":"congestion_control"},{"text":"See also","id":"see_also"}],"summary":"TCP slow start helps buildup transmission speeds to the network's capabilities.
