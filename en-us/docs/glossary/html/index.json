The <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/IETF\">IETF</a> began formally specifying HTML in 1993, and after several drafts released version 2.0 in 1995. In 1994 Berners-Lee founded the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/W3C\">W3C</a> to develop the Web. In 1996, the W3C took over the HTML work and published the HTML 3.2 recommendation a year later. HTML 4.0 was released in 1999 and became an <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/ISO\">ISO</a> standard in 2000.</p>\n<p>At that time, the W3C nearly abandoned HTML in favor of <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/XHTML\">XHTML</a>, prompting the founding of an independent group called <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/WHATWG\">WHATWG</a> in 2004. Thanks to WHATWG, work on HTML continued: the two organizations released the first draft of <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML5\">HTML5</a> in 2008 and an official standard in 2014.
