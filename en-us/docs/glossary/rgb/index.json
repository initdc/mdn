A color model defines how the three components relate to a color space. Graphically, a point in a three-dimensional grid or cube represents a color. Each dimension (or axis) corresponds to a different channel. The RGB color model is then a <em>cubic</em>, or <em>Cartesian</em>, coordinate system of the underlying color space.</p>\n<p>For the web, the underlying color space for an RGB value is <em>sRGB</em> (Standard RGB), and each RGB component is a number between 0 and 255. Float values are supported.</p>\n<p>Note that there are other RGB color spaces, like the <em>Adobe RGB</em> color space, that can represent a wider <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/Gamut\">gamut</a> of color than the <em>sRGB</em> color space. The coordinates in <em>sRGB</em> and <em>Adobe RGB</em> are different.</p>\n<p>There are many ways to describe the RGB components of a color. In <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS\">CSS</a> they can be represented as a single 24-bit integer in hexadecimal notation (for example, <code>#add8e6</code> is light blue), or in functional notation, <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/rgb\"><code>rgb()</code></a> as three separate floats between 0 and 255 (for example, <code>rgb(46 139.5 87)</code>). In <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/OpenGL\">OpenGL</a>, <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/WebGL\">WebGL</a>, and <a class=\"page-not-created\" title=\"The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!\">GLSL</a> the red-green-blue components are fractions (floating-point numbers between 0.0 and 1.0), although in the actual color buffer they are typically stored as 8-bit integers.</p>\n<p>RGB is not the only color model that can represent the <em>sRGB</em> color space. Cylindrical coordinate systems like the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hsl\"><code>HSL</code></a> (<em>hue-saturation-lightness</em>) or <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hwb\"><code>HWB</code></a> (<em>hue-whiteness-blackness</em>) color models are also used to represent a sRGB color on the web.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"see_also","title":"See also","isH3":false,"content":"<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">RGB color model on Wikipedia</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">sRGB color space on Wikipedia</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_RGB_color_space\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Adobe RGB color space on Wikipedia</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value\">CSS data type: &lt;color&gt;</a></li>\n</ul>"}}],"toc":[{"text":"See also","id":"see_also"}],"summary":"Red-Green-Blue (RGB) is a color model that represents colors as mixtures of three underlying components (or channels), namely: red, green, and blue.
