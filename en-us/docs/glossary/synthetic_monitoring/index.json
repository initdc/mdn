Examples of popular synthetic monitoring tools include <a href=\"https://webpagetest.org\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">WebPageTest</a> and <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Lighthouse</a>. The traffic measured is not of your actual users, but rather synthetically generated traffic collecting data on page performance.</p>\n<p>Unlike <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/Real_User_Monitoring\">RUM</a>, synthetic monitoring provides a narrow view of performance that doesn't account for user differences, making it useful in getting basic data about an application's performance and spot-checking performance in development environments. Combined with other tools, such as network throttling, can provide excellent insight into potential problem areas.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"see_also","title":"See also","isH3":false,"content":"<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/Real_User_Monitoring\">Real User Monitoring (RUM)</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Rum-vs-Synthetic\">Real User Monitoring (RUM) versus Synthetic Monitoring</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/beacon\">Beacon</a></li>\n</ul>"}}],"toc":[{"text":"See also","id":"see_also"}],"summary":"Synthetic monitoring involves monitoring the performance of a page in a 'laboratory' environment, typically with automation tooling in an environment that is as consistent as possible.","popularity":0,"modified":"2022-09-21T02:09:26.000Z","other_translations":[{"title":"Synthetic monitoring (合成モニタリング)","locale":"ja","native":"日本語"}],"source":{"folder":"en-us/glossary/synthetic_monitoring","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/style/old/files/en-us/glossary/synthetic_monitoring/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/ed947b2c608428b62a60f07d09dc543f732dc09b","filename":"index.md"},"parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary","title":"MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary/Synthetic_monitoring","title":"Synthetic monitoring"}],"pageTitle":"Synthetic monitoring - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN","noIndexing":false}}
