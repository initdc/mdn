For text the <code>min-content</code> size would be if the text wrapped as small as it can in the inline direction without causing an overflow, doing as much soft-wrapping as possible. For a box containing a string of text, the <code>min-content</code> size would be defined by the longest word. The keyword value of <code>min-content</code> for the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width\"><code>width</code></a> property will size an element according to the <code>min-content</code> size.</p>\n<p>The <code>max-content</code> size is the opposite — in the case of text, this would have the text display as wide as possible, doing no soft-wrapping, even if an overflow was caused. The keyword value <code>max-content</code> exposes this behavior.</p>\n<p>For images the intrinsic size has the same meaning — it is the size that an image would be displayed if no CSS was applied to change the rendering. By default images are assumed to have a \"1x\" pixel density (1 device pixel = 1 CSS pixel) and so the intrinsic size is simply the pixel height and width. The intrinsic image size and resolution can be explicitly specified in the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/EXIF\">EXIF</a> data. The intrinsic pixel density may also be set for images using the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#attr-srcset\"><code>srcset</code></a> attribute (note that if both mechanisms are used, the <code>srcset</code> value is applied \"over\" the EXIF value).</p>"}}],"toc":[],"summary":"In CSS, the intrinsic size of an element is the size it would be based on its content, if no external factors were applied to it.
