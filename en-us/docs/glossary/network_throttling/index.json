In web performance, network throttling, or network condition emulation, it is used to emulate low bandwidth conditions experienced by likely a large segment of a site's target user base.</p>\n<p>It's important not to overlook network conditions users experience on mobile. The internet speeds for developers creating web applications in a corporate office building on a powerful computer are generally very fast. As a developer, tech writer, or designer, this is likely your experience. The network speeds of a mobile user accessing that web application, possibly while traveling or in a remote area with poor data plan coverage, will likely be very slow, if they are able to get online at all. Network throttling enables a developer to emulate an experience of a user. Most browser developer tools, such as the browser inspector, provide a function to emulate different network conditions. By emulating your user's experience via network throttling, you can more readily identify and fix load time issues.</p>\n<p>Browser developer tools generally have network throttling options, to allow you to test your app under slow network conditions. Firefox's developer tools for example have a drop-down menu available in both the <a href=\"https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/network_monitor/index.html\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Network Monitor</a> and <a href=\"https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/responsive_design_mode/index.html\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Responsive Design Mode</a> containing network speed options (e.g. Wi-Fi, good 3G, 2G)</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"see_also","title":"See also","isH3":false,"content":"<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/Synthetic_monitoring\">Synthetic monitoring</a></li>\n</ul>"}}],"toc":[{"text":"See also","id":"see_also"}],"summary":"Network throttling is an intentional slowing down of internet speed.
