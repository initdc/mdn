Chroma subsampling involves implementing less resolution for chroma information than for luma information, taking advantage of the human visual system's lower acuity for color differences than for luminance. A discrete cosine transform expresses a finite sequence of data points in terms of a sum of cosine functions oscillating at different frequencies.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"see_also","title":"See also","isH3":false,"content":"<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">JPEG</a> on Wikipedia</li>\n</ul>"}}],"toc":[{"text":"See also","id":"see_also"}],"summary":"JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is a commonly used method of lossy compression for digital images.","popularity":0.0002,"modified":"2022-09-21T02:09:26.000Z","other_translations":[{"title":"JPEG","locale":"es","native":"Español"},{"title":"JPEG","locale":"fr","native":"Français"},{"title":"JPEG","locale":"ja","native":"日本語"},{"title":"JPEG","locale":"ko","native":"한국어"},{"title":"JPEG","locale":"pt-BR","native":"Português (do Brasil)"},{"title":"JPEG","locale":"ru","native":"Русский"},{"title":"JPEG","locale":"zh-CN","native":"中文 (简体)"},{"title":"JPEG","locale":"zh-TW","native":"正體中文 (繁體)"}],"source":{"folder":"en-us/glossary/jpeg","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/style/old/files/en-us/glossary/jpeg/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/ed947b2c608428b62a60f07d09dc543f732dc09b","filename":"index.md"},"parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary","title":"MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary/jpeg","title":"JPEG"}],"pageTitle":"JPEG - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN","noIndexing":false}}
