For example, the browser must only send <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite\">SameSite</a> cookies to the same site that set them.</p>\n<p>For this more precise definition a site is determined by the <em>registrable domain</em> portion of the domain name. The registrable domain consists of an entry in the <a href=\"https://publicsuffix.org/list/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Public Suffix List</a> plus the portion of the domain name just before it. This means that, for example, <code>theguardian.co.uk</code>, <code>sussex.ac.uk</code>, and <code>bookshop.org</code> are all registrable domains.</p>\n<p>According to this definition, <code>support.mozilla.org</code> and <code>developer.mozilla.org</code> are part of the same site, because <code>mozilla.org</code> is a registrable domain.</p>\n<p>In some contexts, the scheme is also considered when differentiating sites. This would make <code>http://vpl.ca</code> and <code>https://vpl.ca</code> different sites. Including the scheme prevents an insecure (HTTP) site from being treated as the same site as a secure (HTTPS) site. A definition that considers the scheme is sometimes called a <em>schemeful same-site</em>.
