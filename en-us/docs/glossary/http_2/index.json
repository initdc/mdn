All the core concepts found in HTTP 1.1, such as HTTP methods, status codes, URIs, and header fields, remain in place. Instead, HTTP/2 modifies how the data is formatted (framed) and transported between the client and server, both of which manage the entire process, and hides application complexity within the new framing layer. As a result, all existing applications can be delivered without modification.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"see_also","title":"See also","isH3":false,"content":"<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP\">HTTP on MDN</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">HTTP/2</a> on Wikipedia</li>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary\">Glossary</a>\n    <ul>\n      <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP\">HTTP</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/Latency\">Latency</a></li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>"}}],"toc":[{"text":"See also","id":"see_also"}],"summary":"HTTP/2 is a major revision of the HTTP network protocol.","popularity":0.0004,"modified":"2022-09-21T02:09:26.000Z","other_translations":[{"title":"HTTP/2","locale":"fr","native":"Français"},{"title":"HTTP/2","locale":"ja","native":"日本語"},{"title":"HTTP/2","locale":"ko","native":"한국어"},{"title":"HTTP/2","locale":"pt-BR","native":"Português (do Brasil)"},{"title":"HTTP/2","locale":"ru","native":"Русский"},{"title":"HTTP/2","locale":"zh-CN","native":"中文 (简体)"}],"source":{"folder":"en-us/glossary/http_2","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/style/old/files/en-us/glossary/http_2/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/ed947b2c608428b62a60f07d09dc543f732dc09b","filename":"index.md"},"parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary","title":"MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP_2","title":"HTTP/2"}],"pageTitle":"HTTP/2 - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN","noIndexing":false}}
