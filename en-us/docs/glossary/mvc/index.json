Your data model is probably contained in some kind of database (be it a traditional server-side database like MySQL, or a client-side solution such as <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API\">IndexedDB [en-US]</a>.) Your app's controlling code is probably written in HTML/JavaScript, and your user interface is probably written using HTML/CSS/whatever else you like. This sounds very much like MVC, but MVC makes these components follow a more rigid pattern.</p>\n<p>In the early days of the Web, MVC architecture was mostly implemented on the server-side, with the client requesting updates via forms or links, and receiving updated views back to display in the browser. However, these days, more of the logic is pushed to the client with the advent of client-side data stores, and XMLHttpRequest allowing partial page updates as required.</p>\n<p>Web frameworks such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AngularJS\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">AngularJS</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ember.js\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Ember.js</a> all implement an MVC architecture, albeit in slightly different ways.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"see_also","title":"See also","isH3":false,"content":"<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Model–view–controller</a> on Wikipedia</li>\n</ul>"}}],"toc":[{"text":"Model View Controller example","id":"model_view_controller_example"},{"text":"MVC on the web","id":"mvc_on_the_web"},{"text":"See also","id":"see_also"}],"summary":"MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a pattern in software design commonly used to implement user interfaces, data, and controlling logic.
