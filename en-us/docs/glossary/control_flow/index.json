The script submits validated data, but if the user, say, leaves a required field empty, the script prompts them to fill it in. To do this, the script uses a <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/Conditional\">conditional</a> structure or <code>if...else</code>, so that different code executes depending on whether the form is complete or not:</p>\n<div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: js notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token function\">isEmpty</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>field<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token function\">promptUser</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">else</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token function\">submitForm</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>A typical script in <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/JavaScript\">JavaScript</a> or <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/PHP\">PHP</a> (and the like) includes many control structures, including conditionals, <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/loop\">loops</a> and <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/Function\">functions</a>. Parts of a script may also be set to execute when <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/event\">events</a> occur.</p>\n<p>For example, the above excerpt might be inside a function that runs when the user clicks the <strong>Submit</strong> button for the form. The function could also include a loop, which iterates through all of the fields in the form, checking each one in turn. Looking back at the code in the <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> sections, the lines <code>promptUser</code> and <code>submitForm</code> could also be calls to other functions in the script. As you can see, control structures can dictate complex flows of processing even with only a few lines of code.</p>\n<p>Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"see_also","title":"See also","isH3":false,"content":"<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Control flow</a> on Wikipedia</li>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference#control_flow\">JavaScript Reference - Control flow</a> on MDN</li>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Control_flow_and_error_handling\">Statements (Control flow)</a> on MDN</li>\n</ul>"}}],"toc":[{"text":"See also","id":"see_also"}],"summary":"The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.","popularity":0.0011,"modified":"2022-09-21T02:09:26.000Z","other_translations":[{"title":"Structure de contrôle","locale":"fr","native":"Français"},{"title":"Control flow (制御フロー)","locale":"ja","native":"日本語"},{"title":"控制流","locale":"zh-CN","native":"中文 (简体)"}],"source":{"folder":"en-us/glossary/control_flow","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/style/old/files/en-us/glossary/control_flow/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/ed947b2c608428b62a60f07d09dc543f732dc09b","filename":"index.md"},"parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary","title":"MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary/Control_flow","title":"Control flow"}],"pageTitle":"Control flow - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN","noIndexing":false}}
