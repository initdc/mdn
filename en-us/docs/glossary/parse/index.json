Parsing can continue when a CSS file is encountered, but <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags—particularly those without an <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function\"><code>async</code></a> or <code>defer</code> attribute—blocks rendering, and pauses parsing of HTML.</p>\n<p>When the browser encounters CSS styles, it parses the text into the CSS Object Model (or <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSSOM\">CSSOM</a>), a data structure it then uses for styling layouts and painting.
