The on-screen text will never be displayed outside of this box. In addition to describing the size and position of the box in which the text can appear, the <code>&lt;region&gt;</code> element also defines the horizontal and vertical alignment of the text.</p>\n<p>In the example below, we have defined two regions. Both region boxes are the same size, which is 80% of the image width and 80% of the image height. This box is centered on the screen.</p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://mdn.github.io/imsc-examples/layout-top-bottom/layout-top-bottom.html\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n<p>The important items to consider here are:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><code>tts:origin</code> — the upper left corner of the region box, specified as X Y coordinate values. This should be described in percentage values.</li>\n  <li><code>tts:extent</code> — describes how far to the right of the video the region box goes, then how far down.</li>\n  <li><code>tts:backgroundColor</code> — describes the color of the region box. This will most commonly be transparent, however you are welcome to fill it in with a color if that works for your design.</li>\n  <li><code>tts:showBackground</code> — should be set to <code>whenActive</code>. The other allowable value is <code>always</code>, which tells the IMSC decoder to display all region boxes with the value of <code>always</code> at the same time. This is very unlikely to be something you want to do.</li>\n  <li><code>tts:textAlign</code> — the horizontal text justification. Like a word processor, this can be set to <code>left</code>, <code>center</code>, or <code>right</code>. <code>center</code> is the most common text justification for subtitles.</li>\n  <li><code>tts:displayAlign</code> — the vertical alignment of the text. This can be set to <code>before</code>, <code>center</code>, or <code>after</code>. <code>before</code> means that the text will start from the very top of the region box, and flow downwards. <code>center</code> means the text will be vertically centered within the region box. After means that the text will start from the very bottom of the region box, and flow upwards.</li>\n</ul>","titleAsText":"The <region> element"}}],"toc":[{"text":"Considering correct text placement","id":"considering_correct_text_placement"},{"text":"The &lt;region&gt; element","id":"the_region_element"}],"summary":"IMSC allows for very explicit positioning of the text over the video content you are displaying it against.
