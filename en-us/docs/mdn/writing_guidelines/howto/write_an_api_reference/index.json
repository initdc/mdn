At minimum, an API reference should contain a guide called \"Using the <em>name-of-api</em>\", which will provide a basic guide to how to use the API. More complex APIs may require multiple usage guides to explain how to use different aspects of the API.</p>\n<p>If required, you can also include a concepts article called \"<em>name-of-api</em> concepts\", which will provide explanation of the theory behind any concepts related to the API that developers should understand to effectively use it.</p>\n<p>These articles should all be created as subpages of the API overview page. For example, the Web Audio has four guides and a concept article:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Using_Web_Audio_API\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Using_Web_Audio_API</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Visualizations_with_Web_Audio_API\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Visualizations_with_Web_Audio_API</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Web_audio_spatialization_basics\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Web_audio_spatialization_basics</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Migrating_from_webkitAudioContext\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Porting_webkitAudioContext_code_to_standards_based_AudioContext</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Basic_concepts_behind_Web_Audio_API\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Basic_concepts_behind_Web_Audio_API</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"examples\">Examples</h4>\n<p>You should create some examples that demonstrate at least the most common use cases of the API.

Each <a href=\"#interface_pages\">interface page</a> explains what that interface does and provides a list of the methods and properties that comprise the interface. Then each method and property is documented on its own page, which is created as a subpage of the interface it's a member of.
