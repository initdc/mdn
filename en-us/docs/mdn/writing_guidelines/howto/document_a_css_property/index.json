For details about the CSS property, you will need to find a relevant specification for it (e.g., a <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">W3C specification</a>, or a bug report for a non-standard property used in rendering engines like Gecko or Blink).</p>\n<div class=\"notecard note\" id=\"sect1\">\n  <p><strong>Note:</strong> When using a W3C specification, always use the <strong>Editor's Draft</strong> (note the red banner on the left side) and not a published version (e.g., Working Draft).

Remember that the property page you're creating is for a single property, so the examples you add will need to show how this property works in isolation, not how the whole specification is used. Therefore, examples for the <code>list-style-type</code> property should show the results using different values for the property, not how to combine it with other properties, pseudo-classes, or pseudo-elements to generate nice effects. Tutorials and guides can be written to show more.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"step_4_—_get_the_content_reviewed","title":"Step 4 — Get the content reviewed","isH3":false,"content":"<p>After you've created the property page, submit it as a pull request.
