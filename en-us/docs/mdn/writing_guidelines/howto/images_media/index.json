Some of these are listed below:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Video is linear.\n    People don't tend to read online documentation in a linear fashion, starting at the start and reading through to the end.\n    <em>They scan.</em>\n    Video is really hard to scan — it forces the user to consume the content start-to-finish.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Video is less information-dense than text.\n    It takes longer to consume a video explaining something than it does to read the equivalent instructions.\n  </li>\n  <li>Video is big in terms of file size, and therefore, more expensive and less performant than text.</li>\n  <li>Video has accessibility problems: it's more expensive to produce generally than text, but especially to localize, or make usable by screen reader users.</li>\n  <li>Following on from the last point, video is much harder to edit/update/maintain than text content.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"notecard note\" id=\"sect1\">\n  <p><strong>Note:</strong> It's worth keeping these problems in mind even when you are making videos, so you can try to alleviate some of them.</p>\n</div>\n<p>\n  There are many popular video sites that provide a lot of video tutorials.\n  MDN Web Docs isn't a video-driven site, but video does have a place on MDN Web Docs in certain contexts.\n</p>\n<p>\n  We tend to most commonly use video when describing some kind of instruction sequence or multi-step workflow that would be hard to describe concisely in words: <em>\"do this, then do that, then this will happen\"</em>.\n  It is especially useful when trying to describe processes that cross over multiple applications or windows and that include GUI interactions that might not be simple to describe: <em>\"now click on the button near the top-left that looks a bit like a duck\"</em>.\n</p>\n<p>In such cases, it is often more effective to just <strong>show</strong> what you mean.</p><!-- We most commonly use videos when explaining features of the [Firefox DevTools](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/index.html).-->"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"guidelines_for_video_content","title":"Guidelines for video content","isH3":false,"content":"<p>Video content for MDN Web Docs should be:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Short</strong>: Try to keep videos under 30 seconds, ideally under 20 seconds.\n    This is short enough not to make big demands on readers' attention spans.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Simple</strong>: Try to make the workflow simple, 2-4 distinct pieces.\n    This makes them easier to follow.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Silent</strong>: Audio makes videos much more engaging, but they are much more time-consuming to make.\n    Also, having to explain what you're doing makes the videos much longer and adds to the costs (both financial and in terms of time) of localization.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  To explain something more complex, you can use a blend of short videos and screenshots, interspersed with text.\n  The text can help reinforce the points made in the video, and the user can rely on the text or the video as they choose.\n  See <a href=\"https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/page_inspector/how_to/work_with_animations/index.html#animation-inspector\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Working with the Animation Inspector</a> for a good example.\n</p>\n<p>In addition, you should consider the following tips:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    The video will end up being uploaded to YouTube before embedding.\n    We recommend a 16:9 aspect ratio for this use, so that it fills up the entire viewing frame and you don't end up with ugly black bars on the top and bottom (or left and right) of your video.\n    So for example, you might choose a resolution of 1024×576, 1152×648, or 1280×720.\n  </li>\n  <li>Record the video in HD, so that it looks better when uploaded.</li>\n  <li>For DevTools videos, it is often a good idea to choose a contrasting theme to the page content. For example, choose the dark theme if the example webpage is light-themed. It is easier to see what is going on and where the DevTools start and the page ends.</li>\n  <li>For DevTools videos, zoom in the DevTools as much as you can while still showing everything you want to show and making it look OK.</li>\n  <li>Make sure the thing you are trying to demonstrate isn't covered up by the mouse cursor.</li>\n  <li>Consider whether or not it would be useful to configure the screen recording tool to add a visual indicator of mouse clicks.</li>\n</ul>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"guidelines_for_video_tools","title":"Guidelines for video tools","isH3":false,"content":"<p>\n  You'll need a tool for recording the video.\n  These range from free to expensive and simple to complex.\n  If you are already experienced in creating video content, then great.\n  If not, then we'd recommend that you start with a simple tool and then work up to something more complex if you start to enjoy creating video content and want to create more interesting productions.\n</p>\n<p>The following table provides some recommendations for good starter tools:</p>\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Tool</th>\n      <th>OS</th>\n      <th>Cost</th>\n      <th>Post-production features available?</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Open Broadcaster Software</td>\n      <td>macOS, Windows, Linux</td>\n      <td>Free</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>CamStudio</td>\n      <td>Windows</td>\n      <td>Free</td>\n      <td>Limited</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Camtasia</td>\n      <td>Windows, macOS</td>\n      <td>High</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>QuickTime Player</td>\n      <td>macOS</td>\n      <td>Free</td>\n      <td>No, just allows simple recording</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>ScreenFlow</td>\n      <td>macOS</td>\n      <td>Medium</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Kazam</td>\n      <td>Linux</td>\n      <td>Free</td>\n      <td>Minimal</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"quicktime_player_tips","title":"QuickTime Player tips","isH3":true,"content":"<p>\n  If you are using macOS, you should have QuickTime Player available.\n  The recording steps using this tool are pretty simple:\n</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Choose <em>File</em> &gt; <em>New Screen Recording</em> from the main menu.</li>\n  <li>In the <em>Screen Recording</em> box, hit the record button (the red round button).</li>\n  <li>Drag a rectangle round the area of the screen you want to record.</li>\n  <li>Press the <em>Start Recording</em> button.</li>\n  <li>Perform whatever actions you want to record.</li>\n  <li>Press the <em>Stop</em> button.</li>\n  <li>Choose <em>File</em> &gt; <em>Export As...</em> &gt; <em>1080p</em> from the main menu to save as hi definition.</li>\n</ol>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"other_resources","title":"Other resources","isH3":true,"content":"<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://photography.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-add-custom-callouts-to-screencast-videos-in-screenflow--cms-27122\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">How to Add Custom Callouts to Screencast Videos in Screenflow</a></li>\n</ul>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"workflow_for_creating_videos","title":"Workflow for creating videos","isH3":false,"content":"<p>The following subsections describe the general steps you'd want to follow to create a video and add it to an MDN Web Docs article.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"preparing","title":"Preparing","isH3":true,"content":"<p>First, plan the flow you want to capture: consider the best points to start and end.</p>\n<p>\n  Make sure the desktop background and your browser profile are clean.\n  Plan the size and positioning of browser windows, especially if you will be using multiple windows.\n</p>\n<p>Plan carefully what you are actually going to record, and practice the steps a few times before recording them:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Don't start a video in the middle of a process — consider whether the viewer will have enough context for your actions to make sense of them.\n    In a short DevTools video for example, it is a good idea to start by opening the DevTools to allow the viewer to get oriented.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Consider what your actions are, slow down, and make them obvious.\n    Whenever you have to perform an action (say, click an icon), take it slow and make it obvious.
