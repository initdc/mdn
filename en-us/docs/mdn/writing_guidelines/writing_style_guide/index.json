We can achieve this by keeping Search Engine Optimization (<a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/SEO\">SEO</a>) in mind while writing.</p>\n<p>This section covers the standard practices, recommendations, and requirements for content to help ensure that search engines can easily categorize and index our material to ensure that users can easily reach what they need. The SEO guidelines includes ensuring that each page writers and editors work on is reasonably well-designed, written, and marked up to give search engines the context and clues they need to properly index articles.</p>\n<p>The following checklist is good to keep in mind while writing and reviewing content to help ensure that the page and its neighbors will be indexed properly by search engines:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Ensure that pages aren't too similar</strong>: If the content on different pages is similar textually, search engines will assume that the pages are about the same thing even if they aren't.\n    For example, if an interface has the properties <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>, it's easy for the text to be surprisingly similar on the two pages documenting these two properties, with just a few words swapped out and using the same example. This makes it hard for search engines to know which is which, and they wind up sharing page rank, resulting in both being harder to find than they ought to be.\n    It's important, then, to ensure that every page has its own content. Here are some suggestions to help you accomplish that:\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Explain more unique concepts</strong>: Consider use cases where there might be more differences than one would think. For instance, in the case of documenting <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> properties, perhaps write about the ways horizontal space and vertical space are used differently, and provide a discussion about the appropriate concepts. Perhaps you can mention the use of <code>width</code> in terms of making room for a sidebar, while using <code>height</code> to handle vertical scrolling or footers. Including information about accessibility issues is a useful and important idea as well.</li>\n      <li><strong>Use different examples</strong>: Examples in these situations are often even more similar than the body text because the examples may use both (or all) of the similar methods or properties to begin with, thereby requiring no real changes when reused. So throw out the example and write a new one, or at least provide multiple examples, with at least some of them different.</li>\n      <li><strong>Add descriptions for examples</strong>: Both an overview of what the example does as well as coverage of how it works, in an appropriate level of detail given the complexity of the topic and the target audience, should be included.</li>\n    </ul>The easiest way to avoid being overly similar is of course to write each article from scratch if time allows.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Ensure that pages aren't too short</strong>: If the content on a page is too little (called \"thin pages\" in SEO parlance), search engines will not catalog such pages accurately (or at all). Overly-short content pages are hard to find. As a guiding principle, ensure that pages on MDN Web Docs are not shorter than around 300 words or so. Don't artificially inflate a page, but treat this guideline as a minimum target length when possible.\n    Here are some basic guidelines to help you create pages that have enough content to be properly searchable without resorting to cluttering them up with unnecessary text:\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Avoid stubs</strong>: Obviously, if the article is a stub or is missing content, add it. We try to avoid outright \"stub\" pages on MDN web Docs, although they do exist, but there are plenty of pages that are missing large portions of their content.</li>\n      <li><strong>Review page structure</strong>: Review the page to ensure that it's structured properly for the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Page_structures/Page_types\">type of page</a> it is <!--link to be revised-->. Be sure every section that it should have is present and has appropriate content.</li>\n      <li><strong>Ensure completeness</strong>: Review sections to ensure that no information is missing. Ensure that all parameters listed and explained. Ensure that any exceptions are covered — this is a particularly common place where content is missing.</li>\n      <li><strong>Ensure all concepts are fully fleshed-out</strong>: It's easy to give a quick explanation of something, but make sure that all the nuances are covered. Are there special cases? Are there any known restrictions that the reader might need to know about?</li>\n      <li><strong>Add examples</strong>: There should be examples covering all parameters or at least the parameters (or properties, or attributes) that users from the beginner-through-intermediate range are likely to use, as well as any advanced ones that require extra explanation. Each example should be preceded with an overview of what the example will do, what additional knowledge might be needed to understand it, and so forth. After the example (or interspersed among pieces of the example) should be text explaining how the code works. Don't skimp on the details and the handling of errors in examples. Keep in mind that users <em>will</em> copy and paste your example to use in their own projects, and your code <em>will</em> wind up used on production sites! See our <a href=\"/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Writing_style_guide/Code_style_guide\">code example guidelines</a> for more useful information.<!--link to be revised--></li>\n      <li><strong>Explain use cases</strong>: If there are particularly common use cases for the feature being described, talk about them! Instead of assuming that a user will figure out that the method being documented can be used to solve a common development problem, actually add a section about that use case with an example and text explaining how the example works.</li>\n      <li><strong>Add image information</strong>: Include proper <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#attr-alt\"><code>alt</code></a> text on all images and diagrams. This text, as well as captions on tables and other figures, counts because spiders can't crawl images, and so <code>alt</code> text tells search engine crawlers what content the embedded media contains.\n        <div class=\"notecard note\" id=\"sect3\">\n          <p>\n            <strong>Note:</strong> It is not recommended to include too many keywords or keywords not related to the feature in an attempt to manipulate search engine rankings; this type of behavior is easy to spot and tends to be penalized.\n            Likewise, <strong>do not</strong> add repetitive, unhelpful material or blobs of keywords within the actual page, in an attempt to improve the page's size and search ranking. This does more harm than good, both to content readability and to our search results.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      <li><strong>Focus on topic content</strong>: With Google's Hummingbird update in 2013 <!--do we need to retain this-->, there has been an increasing focus on the use of natural language to convey information. This means that it is far better to write content around the topic of the page than a specific keyword. It is highly likely that there will be many keywords you could include for a given topic; in fact, many SEOs compile a list of 5-100 different keywords (varying between short, medium, and long-tail keywords) to include within their article, depending on the length. Doing so will diversify your wording, leading to less repetition.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"writing_style","title":"Writing style","isH3":false,"content":"<p>Other than writing grammatically correct sentences in English, we recommend you follow these guidelines to keep content consistent across MDN Web Docs.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"abbreviations_and_acronyms","title":"Abbreviations and acronyms","isH3":true,"content":"<p>An abbreviation is a shortened version of a longer word, while an acronym is a new word created using the first letter of each word from a phrase.

Cover conceptual information first and then move on to action-oriented topics.\n    Keep the following guidelines in mind when writing titles for a page and sections or subsections:\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Go higher to lower</strong>: As stated in the <a href=\"#heading_levels\">Heading levels</a> section, go from higher <code>##</code> to lower <code>####</code>, without skipping levels. Use higher level headings for broader introductory titles, and use more specific titles as you progress to lower-level headings.</li>\n      <li><strong>Group logically</strong>: Make sure all related subsections are grouped together logically under a higher level heading. Naming titles of various sections can help you in this exercise.</li>\n      <li><strong>Keep titles short</strong>: Shorter titles are easier to scan in text and in table of contents.</li>\n      <li><strong>Keep titles specific</strong>: Use the title to convey the specific information that will be covered in the section. For example, for a section introducing HTML elements, use the title \"HTML elements\" instead of \"Introduction\" or \"Overview\".</li>\n      <li><strong>Keep titles focussed</strong>: Use the title to convey one objective—a single idea or a concept that will be covered in that section. For that purpose, as far as possible, try not to use the conjunction \"and\" in a title.</li>\n      <li><strong>Use parallel construction</strong>: Use similar language for titles at the same heading level. For example, if a <code>###</code> heading level title uses gerunds, that is, words ending in \"-ing\", such as \"Installing\", then try to write all titles at that heading level using gerunds. If a title starts with an imperative verb, such as \"Use\", \"Configure\", then write all titles at that heading level starting with an imperative verb.</li>\n      <li><strong>Avoid common term in lower-level heading</strong>: Do not repeat the text in the title of a higher-level heading in lower-level titles. For example, in a section titled \"Commas\", name the title of a subsection \"After introductory clauses\" instead of \"Commas after introductory clauses\".</li>\n      <li><strong>Don't begin with article</strong>: Avoid starting titles with articles \"a\", \"an\", or \"the\".</li>\n      <li><strong>Add lead-in information</strong>: After a title, add some introductory text to explain what will be covered in the section.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"see_also","title":"See also","isH3":false,"content":""}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"preferred_style_guides","title":"Preferred style guides","isH3":true,"content":"<p>\n  If you have questions about usage and style not covered here, we recommend referring to the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/style-guide/welcome/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Microsoft Writing Style Guide</a>—or, failing that, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Chicago-Manual-Style-16th/dp/0226104206\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Chicago Manual of Style</a>.\n  An <a href=\"https://faculty.cascadia.edu/cma/HIST148/cmscrib.pdf\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">unofficial crib sheet for the Chicago Manual of Style</a> is available online.\n</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"preferred_dictionary","title":"Preferred dictionary","isH3":true,"content":"<p>\n  For questions of spelling, please refer to <a href=\"https://www.dictionary.com/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Dictionary.com</a>.\n  The spelling checker for this site uses American English.\n  Please do not use variant spellings (e.g., use <em>color</em> rather than <em>colour</em>).\n</p>\n<p>We will be expanding the guide over time, so if you have specific questions that aren't covered in this document, <a href=\"/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Contributing/Getting_started#step_4_ask_for_help\">please get in touch</a>, so we know what should be added.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"language_grammar_and_spelling","title":"Language, grammar, and spelling","isH3":true,"content":"<p>If you're interested in improving your writing and editing skills, you may find the following resources to be helpful.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-30th-Anniversary-Nonfiction/dp/0060891548\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">On Writing Well</a>, by William Zinsser (Amazon link)</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Style-Basics-Clarity-Grace-4th/dp/0205830765/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Style: The Basics of Clarity and Grace</a>, by Joseph Williams and Gregory Colomb (Amazon link)</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://brians.wsu.edu/common-errors-in-english-usage/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Common Errors in English</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www-personal.umich.edu/~jlawler/aue.html\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">English Grammar FAQ</a> (alt.usage.english)</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.angryflower.com/bobsqu.gif\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Bob's quick guide to the apostrophe, you idiots</a> (funny)</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Merriam-Websters-Concise-Dictionary-English-Usage/dp/B004L2KNI2\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Merriam-Webster's Concise Dictionary of English Usage</a> (Amazon link): Scholarly but user-friendly, evidence-based advice;
