We are all bound by our Code of Conduct when contributing to MDN, which means adhering to Mozilla's <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Community Participation Guidelines</a>.

We want MDN to be a welcoming, friendly community that we can all be proud of.</li>\n  <li>If a pull request is fine apart from a small typo or some other minor issue, you might want to just fix the issue yourself rather than ask the submitter to change it.

If you are not sure who to approach for help, then ping our <code>@core-yari-content</code> group to ask for help.</li>\n  <li>Related to the above point, it is rare that you'll be required to review a large, complex content change with no warning, like a complete page rewrite, or the addition of several new reference pages or tutorials. Usually such changes are done as part of specific work streams where the content has been approved for addition, and reviewer(s) have been assigned already. In such cases, the PR should be linked to an issue that explains all these details. If you are not sure, ask the submitter if they need a review of the content, and where the rationale behind the change is explained. Ping our team on <a href=\"https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#mdn:mozilla.org\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">MDN Web Docs chat room</a> to ask for help if you are still not sure, or if you think the content is suspicious.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note: You may encounter merge conflicts as you review pull requests, if a another pull request that touches some of the same files got merged before the one you are reviewing. <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Addressing merge conflicts</a> is a useful resource to help you.
