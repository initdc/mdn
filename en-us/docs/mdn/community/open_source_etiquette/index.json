This is our number one bit of advice for anyone starting open source contributions.</p>\n<p>Be kind to the other contributors on the project, and it will be a happier and more productive place. This includes:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Thanking people if they help you.</li>\n  <li>Congratulating people where appropriate (for example if they land their first ever pull request, or fix a particularly difficult bug).</li>\n  <li>Always responding respectfully to people, even if you feel like the answer to their question was a bit obvious, or that they are repeating themselves.</li>\n  <li>Trying to help people to do better next time, in a supportive way, e.g. during pull request reviews or as you answer their questions. Saying \"this is wrong\" or \"here is the answer\" is nowhere near as helpful as saying \"This is OK, but I feel that this would be better if you tried doing it more like this, here's a blog post for more ideas\" or \"you can find the answer here; also check out this link for more common answers\".</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You and the other contributors are (or should be) here because they want to make a positive contribution to the project, but beyond that, you can't assume anything about them. This includes their:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Knowledge of the project and the technologies used to build it</li>\n  <li>Gender, sexuality, age, languages spoken, location, political views, religion, or other personal attributes</li>\n  <li>Experience with open source projects</li>\n  <li>Confidence</li>\n  <li>Expectations</li>\n  <li>Sense of humor</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should therefore keep what you write on topic as much as possible, staying away from potential controversial off-topic subjects like religion or politics, and being supportive and respectful even if you disagree with someone, or don't like a decision they've made.</p>\n<p>Also, you should refrain from any swearing / offensive language, even if it is not directed at anyone in particular. It is not needed for participation, and some people are really sensitive to it.</p>\n<p>Be aware that there are rules in place in any good OSP to protect its contributors against being made to feel uncomfortable while contributing. This usually comes in the form of a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file on GitHub.</p>\n<p>For example, MDN's repos are governed by the wide-reaching <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines</a>. Usually mildly offensive behavior on MDN Web Docs repos (such as constantly being off-topic/disruptive, or being rude) will usually be first responded to by a warning on the repo, followed by a final warning, then a temporary or permanent ban. More serious behavioral problems such as hate speech or threats against another contributor will not be tolerated, and will likely result in an instant ban.</p>\n<p>If you receive anything that makes you feel uncomfortable, you should always report it using the mechanism provided on the code of conduct.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"choose_effective_contributions","title":"Choose effective contributions","isH3":false,"content":"<p>Think about what you want to do on the project.
