TLS 1.3 includes numerous changes that improve security and performance. The goals of TLS 1.3 are:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Remove unused and unsafe features of TLS 1.2.</li>\n  <li>Include strong security analysis in the design.</li>\n  <li>Improve privacy by encrypting more of the protocol.</li>\n  <li>Reduce the time needed to complete a handshake.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>TLS 1.3 changes much of the protocol fundamentals, but preserves almost all of the basic capabilities of previous TLS versions. For the web, TLS 1.3 can be enabled without affecting compatibility with some rare exceptions (see below).</p>\n<p>The major changes in TLS 1.3 are:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The TLS 1.3 handshake completes in one round trip in most cases, reducing handshake latency.</li>\n  <li>A server can enable a 0-RTT (zero round trip time) handshake. Clients that reconnect to the server can send requests immediately, eliminating the latency of the TLS handshake entirely. Though the performance gains from 0-RTT can be significant, they come with some risk of replay attack, so some care is needed before enabling this feature.</li>\n  <li>TLS 1.3 supports forward-secure modes only, unless the connection is resumed or it uses a pre-shared key.</li>\n  <li>TLS 1.3 defines a new set of cipher suites that are exclusive to TLS 1.3. These cipher suites all use modern Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithms.</li>\n  <li>The TLS 1.3 handshake is encrypted, except for the messages that are necessary to establish a shared secret. In particular, this means that server and client certificates are encrypted. Note however that the server identity (the server_name or SNI extension) that a client sends to the server is not encrypted.</li>\n  <li>Numerous mechanisms have been disabled: renegotiation, generic data compression, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Digital Signature Algorithm</a> (DSA) certificates, static RSA key exchange, and key exchange with custom Diffie-Hellman (DH) groups.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Implementations of draft versions of TLS 1.3 are available. TLS 1.3 is enabled in some browsers, including the 0-RTT mode. Web servers that enable TLS 1.3 might need to adjust configuration to allow TLS 1.3 to operate successfully.</p>\n<p>TLS 1.3 adds just one significant new use case. The 0-RTT handshake can provide significant performance gains for latency sensitive applications, like the web. Enabling 0-RTT requires additional steps, both to ensure successful deployment and to manage the risks of replay attacks.</p>\n<p>The removal of renegotiation in TLS 1.3 might affect some web servers that rely on client authentication using certificates. Some web servers use renegotiation to either ensure that client certificates are encrypted, or to request client certificates only when certain resources are requested. For the privacy of client certificates, the encryption of the TLS 1.3 handshake ensures that client certificates are encrypted; however this might require some software changes. Reactive client authentication using certificates is supported by TLS 1.3 but not widely implemented. Alternative mechanisms are in the process of being developed, which will also support HTTP/2.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"retiring_old_tls_versions","title":"Retiring old TLS versions","isH3":false,"content":"<p>To help with working towards a more modern, more secure web, all major browsers began removing support for TLS 1.0 and 1.1 in early 2020.
