happening:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>GET endpoints should be idempotent—actions that enact a change and do not retrieve data should require sending a POST (or other HTTP method) request. POST endpoints should not interchangeably accept GET requests with parameters in the query string.</li>\n  <li>A CSRF token should be included in &lt;form&gt; elements via a hidden input field. This token should be unique per user and stored (for example, in a cookie) such that the server can look up the expected value when the request is sent. For all non-GET requests that have the potential to perform an action, this input field should be compared against the expected value. If there is a mismatch, the request should be aborted.</li>\n  <li>This method of protection relies on an attacker being unable to predict the user's assigned CSRF token. The token should be regenerated on sign-in.</li>\n  <li>Cookies that are used for sensitive actions (such as session cookies) should have a short lifetime with the SameSite attribute set to Strict or Lax. (See SameSite cookies above). In supporting browsers, this will have the effect of ensuring that the session cookie is not sent along with cross-site requests and so the request is effectively unauthenticated to the application server.</li>\n  <li>Both CSRF tokens and SameSite cookies should be deployed. This ensures all browsers are protected and provides protection where SameSite cookies cannot help (such as attacks originating from a separate subdomain).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more prevention tips, see the OWASP CSRF prevention cheat sheet.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"man-in-the-middle_mitm","title":"Man-in-the-middle (MitM)","isH3":false,"content":"<p>A third party intercepts traffic between a web server and a client (browser), and impersonates the web server in order to capture data (such as login credentials or credit card information).

Stealing cookies is one way to do this.</p>\n<p>Recall that a subdomain such as application.example.com can set a cookie to be sent with requests to example.com or other sub-domains by setting the <code>Domain</code> attribute:</p>\n<div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: http notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token header\"><span class=\"token header-name keyword\">Set-Cookie</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token header-value\">CSRF=e8b667; Secure; Domain=example.com</span></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>\n  If a vulnerable application is available on a sub-domain, this mechanism can be abused in a session fixation attack. When the user visits a page on the parent domain (or another subdomain), the application may trust the existing value sent in the user's cookie. This could allow an attacker to bypass CSRF protection or hijack a session after the user logs in.\n  Alternatively, if the parent domain does not use <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/HSTS\">HTTP Strict-Transport-Security</a> with <code>includeSubdomains</code> set, a user subject to an active MitM (perhaps connected to an open Wi-Fi network) could be served a response with a Set-Cookie header from a non-existent sub-domain. The end result would be much the same, with the browser storing the illegitimate cookie and sending it to all other pages under example.com.\n</p>\n<p>Session fixation should primarily be mitigated by regenerating session cookie values when the user authenticates (even if a cookie already exists) and by tieing any CSRF token to the user.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"session_side-jacking","title":"Session side-jacking","isH3":true,"content":""}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"browser_hijacking_malware","title":"Browser hijacking malware","isH3":true,"content":""}}],"toc":[{"text":"Click-jacking","id":"click-jacking"},{"text":"Cross-site scripting (XSS)","id":"cross-site_scripting_xss"},{"text":"Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)","id":"cross-site_request_forgery_csrf"},{"text":"Man-in-the-middle (MitM)","id":"man-in-the-middle_mitm"},{"text":"Session hijacking","id":"session_hijacking"}],"summary":"This article describes various types of security attacks and techniques to mitigate them.","popularity":0.0024,"modified":"2022-09-14T09:21:13.000Z","other_translations":[{"title":"Tipos de ataques","locale":"es","native":"Español"},{"title":"攻撃の種類","locale":"ja","native":"日本語"}],"source":{"folder":"en-us/web/security/types_of_attacks","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/style/old/files/en-us/web/security/types_of_attacks/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/f42cbd9709e5c61e3d4833f6d911aae9bed5275d","filename":"index.md"},"parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"Web technology for developers"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Security","title":"Web security"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Types_of_attacks","title":"Types of attacks"}],"pageTitle":"Types of attacks - Web security | MDN","noIndexing":false}}
