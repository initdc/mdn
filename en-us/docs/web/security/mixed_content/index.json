For example, an attacker could replace an image served over HTTP with an inappropriate image or message to the user.

This type of mixed content can alter the behavior of the HTTPS page and potentially steal sensitive data from the user. Hence, in addition to the risks described for mixed display content above, mixed active content is vulnerable to a few other attack vectors.</p>\n<p>In the mixed active content case, a man-in-the-middle attacker can intercept the request for the HTTP content. The attacker can also rewrite the response to include malicious JavaScript code. Malicious active content can steal the user's credentials, acquire sensitive data about the user, or attempt to install malware on the user's system (by leveraging vulnerabilities in the browser or its plugins, for example).</p>\n<p>The risk involved with mixed content does depend on the type of website the user is visiting and how sensitive the data exposed to that site may be. The webpage may have public data visible to the world or private data visible only when authenticated. If the webpage is public and has no sensitive data about the user, using mixed active content still provides the attacker with the opportunity to redirect the user to other HTTP pages and steal HTTP cookies from those sites.</p>\n<h4 id=\"active_content_examples\">Active content examples</h4>\n<p>This section lists some types of HTTP requests which are considered active content:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script\"><code>&lt;script&gt;</code></a> (<code>src</code> attribute)</li>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link\"><code>&lt;link&gt;</code></a> (<code>href</code> attribute) (this includes CSS stylesheets)</li>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe\"><code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code></a> (<code>src</code> attribute)</li>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest\"><code>XMLHttpRequest</code></a> requests</li>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch\"><code>fetch()</code></a> requests</li>\n  <li>All cases in CSS where a <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/url\"><code>url()</code></a> value is used (<a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face\"><code>@font-face</code></a>, <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/cursor\"><code>cursor</code></a>, <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-image\"><code>background-image</code></a>, and so forth).</li>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/object\"><code>&lt;object&gt;</code></a> (<code>data</code> attribute)</li>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/sendBeacon\"><code>Navigator.sendBeacon</code></a> (<code>url</code> attribute)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other resource types like web fonts and workers may be considered active mixed content, as they are in Chrome.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"loading_mixed-content_resources","title":"Loading mixed-content resources","isH3":false,"content":"<p>Most browsers prevent <em>mixed active content</em> from loading, and some also block <em>mixed display content</em>.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"loading_locally_delivered_mixed-resources","title":"Loading locally delivered mixed-resources","isH3":true,"content":"<p>Browsers <em>may</em> allow locally-delivered mixed resources to be loaded.
