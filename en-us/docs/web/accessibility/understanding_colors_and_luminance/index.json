The fact is that in the visible range, light simply exists at different frequencies, or wavelengths. Consider how the keys on a piano create sounds at different frequencies. But while our ear and aural perception may \"hear\" sound as a range of notes, the normal human eye divides the visible light into three overlapping ranges. These three bands of light are detected by light sensitive cells in the eye known as cones, and the three cone types are called L, M, or S for long, medium, and short wavelengths.</p>\n<p>We normally associate L, M, or S cone sensitivity with the sensation of red, green, and blue colors, respectively, the three primary colors of light. Specific red, green, and blue hues are used for the \"color primaries\" used in an RGB additive color model.

The separate red and green stimulate the L and M cones similarly to how a \"yellow\" wavelength of light might, as yellow is \"in between\" red and green.

Because hue is adjusted as an angle, it is easy to create a user interface using a knob or circular control to adjust hue.</p>\n<p>Next, we can set the sRGB values directly, as a percentage, 0% being off (black) and 100% being the full value for that color. The values are in the order of red, green, blue.</p>\n<p>We can also set the sRGB values directly by an 8bit integer number, which means a whole number from 0 to 255. This is the number of values available in an 8bit byte, which is how numbers are often stored in a computer.</p>\n<p>Shown after that, we can use a hex value. Hex value means \"hexadecimal,\" where the 0-255 integer is represented by two digits that each range from 0-15. As there are no Arabic numerals above 9, we use the letters a-f to represent 10-15. We add the '#' symbol to indicate the value is hex. Thus, #ff = 255.</p>\n<p>In some of the previous examples, you'll notice that some have a fourth value which is called \"alpha\", the A in RGBA. The alpha channel is not a color channel, but defines transparency in terms of the opacity value of the color. A higher value means the color is more opaque therefore less transparent.
