The mechanism for this is poorly understood, but is believed to be linked to \"gamma oscillations\" set up in the brain. These oscillations in the brain are a different kind of response than other kinds of neurological responses believed to cause photosensitive seizures.</p>\n<p>Stripes and patterns are typical of the kinds of images that create problems, and stripes have been studied most closely. There's the potential for causing harm if there are more than five light-dark pairs of stripes in any orientation.

The web developer can do something about this in the manner in which they display math. Animation figures strongly in this arena.

Adobe Illustrator, for example, allows one to Typeset ADA Braille for printing out.</p>\n<p>The ability to represent spatial patterns accurate to those who are blind is critical for accessibility. For example, knowing Braille is not enough. The Braille dots have to be spatially apart from one another so as to be readable in a \"human\" way. The human touch does distinguish with ease braille dots that are too close or too far apart from one another.</p>\n<p>Space has to surround the braille character. A user of braille does not lay a finger on \"top\" of a braille character, the user has to move her finger over the character, in the way that a sighted person must move her eyes across text written on a page.</p>\n<p>The nature of space can change depending upon what MIME type is being used, and its version.
