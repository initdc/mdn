Content that flickers, flashes, or blinks can trigger photosensitive epilepsy. Web technologies that use video, animated gifs, animated pngs, animated SVGs, Canvas, and CSS or JavaScript animations are all capable of content that can induce seizures or other incapacitating physical reactions. Certain visual patterns, especially stripes, can also cause physical reactions even though they are not animated. Photosensitive epilepsy is actually a kind of \"reflex epilepsy\"—seizures occurring in response to a trigger. In the case of photosensitive epilepsy, seizures are triggered specifically by flashing lights, but other types of reflex epilepsies may be triggered by the act of reading, or by noises. Patterns and images can also trigger epilepsy.</p>\n<p>The fact that static images may cause seizures and other disorders is documented in articles such as <a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982217304062\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">\"Gamma Oscillations and photosensitive epilepsy\"</a>, where it is noted \"<em>Certain visual images, even in the absence of motion or flicker, can trigger seizures in patients with photosensitive epilepsy</em>\". The Epilepsy Foundation, in its article, <a href=\"https://www.epilepsy.com/stories/shedding-light-photosensitivity-one-epilepsys-most-complex-conditions-0\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">\"Shedding Light on Photosensitivity, One of Epilepsy's Most Complex Conditions\"</a> talks about static images and patterns: \"<em>Static or moving patterns of discernable light and dark stripes have the same effect as flashing lights because of the alternation of dark and bright areas.\"</em> The Epilepsy Foundation of America Working Group is able to \"quantify\" the problem a little: <em>\"A pattern with the potential for provoking seizures contains clearly discernible stripes, numbering more than five light-dark pairs of stripes in any orientation</em>\". In addition to stripes, checkered patterns have also been known to cause photosensitive seizures, according to <a href=\"https://www.cedars-sinai.org/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/p/photosensitive-seizures.html\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Cedars-Sinai</a>.</p>\n<p>Although static images are possible as triggers, they are less consistent. The trigger that is well established and strong is flashing/strobe lights. Dr. Selim Benbadis of USF's Comprehensive Epilepsy Program notes, <em>\"The only thing that is really documented is flashing lights, which can trigger seizures in patients with photosensitive epilepsy. Only a few types of epilepsies are photosensitive though, and the vast majority of epilepsies are not.\"</em> In addition to seizures brought about by photosensitivity, listening to certain pieces of music can also trigger what are called musicogenic seizures, although these types of seizures seem to be much more rare. For a great introduction on the topic of musicogenic seizures, visit Epilepsy Ontario's web page on <a href=\"https://epilepsyontario.org/musicogenic-seizures/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Musicogenic Seizures</a>.</p>\n<p>Seizures and epilepsy are not the same. In its article <a href=\"https://www.epilepsy.com/stories/revised-definition-epilepsy\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">\"A Revised Definition of Epilepsy\"</a>, the Epilepsy Foundation notes that \"<em>a seizure is an event and epilepsy is the disease involving recurrent unprovoked seizures</em>.\" According to the Epilepsy Foundation's page <a href=\"https://www.epilepsy.com/what-is-epilepsy/understanding-seizures/how-serious-are-seizures\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">\"How Serious Are Seizures?\"</a>, <em>\"Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is likely the most common disease-related cause of death in with epilepsy. It is not frequent but it is a very real problem and people need to be aware of its risk\"</em>.</p>\n<p>The point is, seizures most definitely can be and are fatal, and developers and designers are incredibly important for making the web a safer place for those with sensitivities to photosensitive or musicogenic triggers.</p>\n<p>Seizures can be fatal, but even the ones that are \"only\" debilitating can be of such severity that they render the user incapacitated. Other disorders, such as disorientation, nausea, vomiting, and more can also be so severe that the user is unable to function. The Epilepsy Foundation's article, <a href=\"https://www.epilepsy.com/what-is-epilepsy/seizure-triggers/photosensitivity\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">\"Photosensitivity and Seizures\"</a>, provides a list of triggers that may cause seizures in photosensitive people; here's an excerpt from that list:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Television screens or computer monitors due to the flicker or rolling images.</li>\n  <li>Certain video games or TV broadcasts containing rapid flashes or alternating patterns of different colors.</li>\n  <li>Intense strobe lights like visual fire alarms.</li>\n  <li>Natural light, such as sunlight, especially when shimmering off water, flickering through trees or through the slats of Venetian blinds.</li>\n  <li>Certain visual patterns, especially stripes of contrasting colors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That same article continues that many factors must combine to trigger the photosensitive reaction. Of note is that it includes the wavelength of light as a possible factor; wavelengths in the red part of the spectrum seem to be especially problematic. In the article, <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/seizure-does-not-violate.html\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">\"Understanding WCAG 2.0 Three Flashes or Below Threshold\"</a> notes generally that: <em>\"Individuals who have photosensitive seizure disorders can have a seizure triggered by content that flashes at certain frequencies for more than a few flashes\"</em> and goes on to note, very specifically that: \"<em>People are even more sensitive to red flashing than to other colors, so a special test is provided for saturated red flashing</em>\".</p>\n<p>You don't even need an image or video to cause harm. A <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div\"><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></a> element set to change color and luminosity at high frequency, easily done via JavaScript, can cause real harm. And, flickering can occur everywhere. For example, \"spinners\" commonly used to display while pages load can easily \"flicker\" while spinning.</p>\n<p>Additional concerns exist for individuals with motor-skill problems. For example, the page for Trace Research &amp; Development Center's <a href=\"https://trace.umd.edu/peat/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Photosensitive Epilepsy Analysis Tool</a> notes that <em>\"Photosensitive seizures can be provoked by certain types of flashing in web or computer content, including mouse-overs that cause large areas of the screen to rapidly flash on and off repeatedly\"</em>.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"other_physical_reactions","title":"Other physical reactions","isH3":true,"content":"<p>Nausea, vertigo (or dizziness), and disorientation are very nonspecific symptoms associated with all kinds of diseases and not particularly suggestive of seizures (except maybe disorientation, which is seen in seizures).

Generally speaking, limit the size of the flash to an area approximately 341 by 256 pixels or less. This pixel size assumes that a viewer is at a typical distance from the screen. As mentioned earlier, this size may be too big if the image is to be viewed at close range, such as in a VR headset. WebVR is an open specification that makes it possible to experience VR in your browser. WebVR can be experienced on phone, computer or headset.</p>\n<p>If you are designing for a game or VR that uses an ocular mask, <strong>or CAN be used by an ocular mask</strong>, such as in Firefox Reality (a browser for virtual reality), ensure that the size of the rectangle is much smaller than 341 by 256 pixels, because the image is much closer to a user's eyes.</p>\n<h4 id=\"reduce_contrast\">Reduce contrast</h4>\n<p>Normally, higher contrast is a good thing when it comes to accessibility. The greater the contrast of a text color to its background (technically called <em>luminosity contrast ratio,</em> according to W3.org's page on <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/contrast/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Colors with Good Contrast</a>, the easier such content is to read. Users with low vision are especially appreciative of efforts to ensure high contrast of text against its background. When the content is animated, however, <strong><em>reducing</em></strong> contrast is actually a way to reduce the likelihood that the animated content will cause seizures. Drop the contrast ratio if three flashes within one second are detected.</p>\n<p>The contrast ratio is defined in <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">WCAG 2.1</a> as follows:</p>\n<dl>\n  <dt id=\"contrast_ratio\"><em>contrast ratio</em></dt>\n  <dd>\n    <p>(L1 + 0.05) / (L2 + 0.05), where</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>L1 is the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-relative-luminance\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">relative luminance</a> of the lighter of the colors, and</li>\n      <li>L2 is the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-relative-luminance\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">relative luminance</a> of the darker of the colors.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </dd>\n</dl>\n<p>It's best if you can adjust the contrast before it is uploaded or published to the web. For videos and animated GIFS, the Adobe Suite of products is a phenomenal resource for traditional images. Also for images, an online tool available is pinetools.com's <a href=\"https://pinetools.com/brightness-contrast-image\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Brightness and contrast online</a>. If you intend to make animated gifs, for example, start with one that has a lower contrast ratio.</p>\n<p>JavaScript is also an option for reducing contrast dynamically.

Among their results was the understanding that <em>\"A flash is a potential hazard if it has luminance at least 20 cd/m2, occurs at a frequency of least 3 Hz, and occupies a solid visual angle of at least 0.006 steradians (about 10% of the central visual field or 25% of screen area at typical viewing distances).

Not all users know to look for these options via the browser or settings, so it's worth considering doing things the old-fashioned way, with obvious buttons or links to change the style so that users can see them.
