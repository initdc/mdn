Sometimes the embedded object is really just another text container with more embedded objects.</p>\n<p>However in accessibility hierarchies such as ATK and IAccessible2, text is not exposed in leaf nodes as it is in a W3C DOM. The text is actually exposed via a special text interface in the parent of the text nodes. It is concatenated together with all its sibling text nodes, and embedded objects between the text nodes are exposed as the unicode embedded object character <code>\\xfffc</code>. One reason for this is that there are fewer nodes to pass across process, and that improves performance.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"node_types","title":"Node types","isH3":false,"content":"<ul>\n  <li>Text content (ROLE_TEXT) objects are implemented by nsTextAccessible.
