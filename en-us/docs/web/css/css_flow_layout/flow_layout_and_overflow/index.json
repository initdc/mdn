Once it fills the box, it continues to overflow in a visible way, displaying content outside the box, potentially displaying under subsequent content. The property that controls how overflow behaves is the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow\"><code>overflow</code></a> property which has an initial value of <code>visible</code>.

If you specify only one value for overflow, this value is used for both axes. However, you can specify both values in which case the first is used for <code>overflow-x</code> and therefore the horizontal direction, and the second for <code>overflow-y</code> and the vertical direction. In the below example, I have only specified <code>overflow-y: scroll</code> so we do not get the unwanted horizontal scrollbar.</p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/flow/overflow/overflow-y.html\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"flow_relative_properties","title":"Flow Relative Properties","isH3":false,"content":"<p>In the guide to <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flow_Layout/Flow_Layout_and_Writing_Modes\">Writing Modes and Flow Layout</a>, we looked at the newer properties of <code>block-size</code> and <code>inline-size</code> which make more sense when working with different writing modes than tying our layout to the physical dimensions of the screen.
