This defines the start and end of the inline direction. The start is where sentences start and the end is where a line of text ends before it would begin to wrap onto a new line.</p>\n<p>The <em>block flow direction</em> is the direction in which boxes, for example paragraphs, stack in that writing mode. The CSS writing-mode property controls the block flow direction. If you want to change your page, or part of your page, to <code>vertical-lr</code> then you can set <code>writing-mode: vertical-lr</code> on the element and this will change the direction of the blocks and therefore the inline direction as well.</p>\n<p>While certain languages will use a particular writing mode or text direction, we can also use these properties for creative effect, such as running a heading vertically.</p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/flow/writing-modes/creative-use.html\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"block_flow_direction","title":"Block flow direction","isH3":false,"content":"<p>The <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/writing-mode\"><code>writing-mode</code></a> property accepts the values <code>horizontal-tb</code>, <code>vertical-rl</code> and <code>vertical-lr</code>.
