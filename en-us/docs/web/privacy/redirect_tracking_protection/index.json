In the past, each of these websites could embed resources from the same tracker, and the tracker could use its cookies to link all of these page visits to the same person. To protect the privacy of Firefox users, <a href=\"https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-desktop\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Enhanced Tracking Protection</a> (ETP) already blocks trackers from using cookies when they are embedded in a third-party context, but still allows them to use cookies as a first party because blocking first party cookies causes websites to break. Redirect tracking takes advantage of this to circumvent third-party cookie blocking.</p>\n<p>Redirect trackers work by forcing you to make an imperceptible and momentary stopover to their website as part of that journey. So instead of navigating directly from the review website to the retailer, you'll end up navigating to the redirect tracker first rather than to the retailer. This means that the tracker is loaded as a first party. The redirect tracker associates tracking data with the identifiers they have stored in their first-party cookies and then forwards you to the retailer.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"redirect_tracking_protection_explained","title":"Redirect tracking protection explained","isH3":false,"content":"<p>To protect against redirect tracking Firefox periodically clears cookies and site data from trackers.
