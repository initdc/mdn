As such, PII extends beyond the web to all aspects of life. For example, if a site leaks a list of users' names and zip codes online, a bad actor could almost certainly track down at least some percentage of those users by using the corresponding phone books.</p>\n    <p>Personally identification can include information like usernames, real names, passwords, phone numbers or addresses (or even portions of them), information about medical history, Social Security Numbers, driver licenses, or any other form of ID or ID number, credit card information, and so forth. It's a very broad range of information. Whenever working with data, always stop and think: is there any way this can be used to even through many steps identify a specific person?</p>\n  </dd>\n  <dt id=\"privacy\">Privacy</dt>\n  <dd>\n    <p>The concept of privacy is somewhat hard to define. Everyone has some idea what it means to keep something private, but when talking about the privacy of data, it becomes murky. Fundamentally, privacy of your data on the internet is about ensuring that information that has personal implications is kept out of the hands of unauthorized persons or organizations, regardless of how it's obtained.</p>\n    <p>Privacy exceptions may be granted to specific sites or applications, but it may also be granted <em>conditionally</em>, such as by permitting only a select group of people to access it, or only allowing the information to be accessed and used for a limited period of time.</p>\n  </dd>\n  <dt id=\"security\">Security</dt>\n  <dd>\n    <p>Security is about the active protection of data or a system against being accessed, downloaded, or operated by people or organizations that don't have permission to do so. Good security practices aim to prevent unauthorized access to systems or data, regardless of what the target is.</p>\n  </dd>\n</dl>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"personal_and_private_information","title":"Personal and private information","isH3":false,"content":"<!--what kind of information is private or personal?-->"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"privacy_risks","title":"Privacy risks","isH3":false,"content":"<!--what are ways personal information can be gotten by third parties?-->"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"fingerprinting","title":"Fingerprinting","isH3":true,"content":"<p><strong>Fingerprinting</strong> is a technique used to gather a variety of information that's made available by a user's browser and collating it until it becomes possible to uniquely identify that user's browser. Even seemingly innocuous information can in principle be used in the fingerprinting process, though the more unique the information is to the particular device the better.</p>\n<p>Modern browsers take steps to help prevent fingerprinting-based attacks by either not allowing information to be accessed or, where the information must be made available, by introducing variations that prevent it from being used for identification purposes.</p>\n<p>For example, if a web site queries a user's browser for the elapsed time, a comparison of that time to the time as reported by the server might be useful as a factor in fingerprinting. Because of this, browsers typically introduce a small amount of variability to timers in order to make them less useful for identifying the user's system.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"new_privacy_technology","title":"New privacy technology","isH3":false,"content":"<p>Web browsers are actively working on improving the privacy space through new features:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Firefox_tracking_protection\">Firefox tracking protection</a></li><li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Redirect_tracking_protection\">Redirect tracking protection</a></li><li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/State_Partitioning\">State Partitioning</a></li><li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Storage_Access_Policy\">Storage access policy: Block cookies from trackers</a></li></ul>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"privacy_and_security_controls","title":"Privacy and security controls","isH3":false,"content":"<p>There are multiple layers of controls for helping to protect users against security and privacy breaches.
