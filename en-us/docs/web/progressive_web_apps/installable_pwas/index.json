The installed web app can then be launched by users just as if it were any native app. This article explains how to achieve this using the web app's manifest.</p>\n<p>These technologies allow the app to be launched directly from the device's home screen, rather than the user having to open the browser and then navigate to the site by using a bookmark or typing the URL. Your web app can sit next to native applications as first class citizens. This makes the web app easier to access; additionally, you can specify that the app be launched in fullscreen or standalone mode, thus removing the default browser user interface that would otherwise be present, creating an even more seamless and native-like feel.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"requirements","title":"Requirements","isH3":false,"content":"<p>To make the web site installable, it needs the following things in place:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>A web manifest, with the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Add_to_home_screen#manifest\">correct fields filled in</a></li>\n  <li>The web site to be served from a secure (HTTPS) domain</li>\n  <li>An icon to represent the app on the device</li>\n  <li>A <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API\">service worker</a> registered, to allow the app to work offline (this is required only by Chrome for Android currently)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"notecard note\" id=\"sect1\">\n  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Currently, only the Chromium-based browsers such as Chrome, Edge, and Samsung Internet require the service worker.
