To be fast to load, the developers' goals include sending requested information as fast as possible, or at least seem super fast. Network latency is the time it takes to transmit bytes over-the-air to computers.

For smooth interactions, the developer's goal is to ensure performant site interactions, from smooth scrolling to being responsive to touch. Render time is key, with ensuring the main thread can complete all the work we throw at it and still always be available to handle user interactions. Web performance can be improved by understanding the single-threaded nature of the browser and minimizing the main thread's responsibilities, where possible and appropriate, to ensure rendering is smooth and responses to interactions are immediate.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"navigation","title":"Navigation","isH3":false,"content":"<p><em>Navigation</em> is the first step in loading a web page.
