You're still using XML and its syntax, but you're additionally restricted by a structure you agreed on. WebSocket subprotocols are just like that. They do not introduce anything fancy, they just establish structure. Like a doctype or schema, both parties must agree on the subprotocol; unlike a doctype or schema, the subprotocol is implemented on the server and cannot be externally referred to by the client.</p>\n<div class=\"notecard note\" id=\"sect11\">\n  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Subprotocols are explained in sections 1.9, 4.2, 11.3.4, and 11.5 of the spec.</p>\n</div>\n<p>A client has to ask for a specific subprotocol. To do so, it will send something like this <em>as part of the original handshake</em>:</p>\n<div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: bash notranslate\"><code>GET /chat HTTP/1.1\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">..</span>.\nSec-WebSocket-Protocol: soap, wamp\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>or, equivalently:</p>\n<div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: bash notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token punctuation\">..</span>.\nSec-WebSocket-Protocol: soap\nSec-WebSocket-Protocol: wamp\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now the server must pick one of the protocols that the client suggested and it supports. If there is more than one, send the first one the client sent. Imagine our server can use both <code>soap</code> and <code>wamp</code>. Then, in the response handshake, it sends:</p>\n<div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: bash notranslate\"><code>Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: soap\n</code></pre></div>\n<div class=\"notecard warning\" id=\"sect12\">\n  <p>\n    <strong>Warning:</strong> The server can't send more than one <code>Sec-Websocket-Protocol</code> header.\n    If the server doesn't want to use any subprotocol, <strong><em>it shouldn't send any <code>Sec-WebSocket-Protocol</code> header</em></strong>. Sending a blank header is incorrect. The client may close the connection if it doesn't get the subprotocol it wants.\n  </p>\n</div>\n<p>If you want your server to obey certain subprotocols, then naturally you'll need extra code on the server. Let's imagine we're using a subprotocol <code>json</code>. In this subprotocol, all data is passed as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">JSON</a>. If the client solicits this protocol and the server wants to use it, the server needs to have a JSON parser. Practically speaking, this will be part of a library, but the server needs to pass the data around.</p>\n<div class=\"notecard note\" id=\"sect13\">\n  <p><strong>Note:</strong> To avoid name conflict, it's recommended to make your subprotocol name part of a domain string. If you are building a custom chat app that uses a proprietary format exclusive to Example Inc., then you might use this: <code>Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat.example.com</code>. Note that this isn't required, it's just an optional convention, and you can use any string you wish.</p>\n</div>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"related","title":"Related","isH3":false,"content":"<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_WebSocket_client_applications\">Writing WebSocket client applications</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_WebSocket_server\">Tutorial: Websocket server in C#</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_a_WebSocket_server_in_Java\">Tutorial: Websocket server in Java</a></li>\n</ul>"}}],"toc":[{"text":"The WebSocket handshake","id":"the_websocket_handshake"},{"text":"Exchanging data frames","id":"exchanging_data_frames"},{"text":"Pings and Pongs: The Heartbeat of WebSockets","id":"pings_and_pongs_the_heartbeat_of_websockets"},{"text":"Closing the connection","id":"closing_the_connection"},{"text":"Miscellaneous","id":"miscellaneous"},{"text":"Related","id":"related"}],"summary":"A WebSocket server is nothing more than an application listening on any port of a TCP server that follows a specific protocol.
