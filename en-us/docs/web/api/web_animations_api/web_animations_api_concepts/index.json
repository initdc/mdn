Back then it was the only animation engine browsers had to worry about. While four out of five browsers supported SMIL, it only animated SVG elements, could not be used from CSS, and was very complex — often leading to inconsistent implementations. Ten years later, the Safari team introduced the <a href=\"https://drafts.csswg.org/css-animations/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">CSS Animations</a> and <a href=\"https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transitions/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">CSS Transitions</a> specs.</p>\n<p>The Internet Explorer team requested an animations API to consolidate and normalize animation functionality across all browsers, and thus efforts began in earnest among Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome developers to create the one animation spec to rule them all: the Web Animations API. Now we've got the WAAPI for future animation specifications to piggyback on, allowing them to remain consistent and play well together. It also provides a point of reference all browsers can adhere to with the currently available specs.</p>\n<p>\n  <img src=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API/Web_Animations_API_Concepts/waapi_diagram_white.png\" alt=\"An illustration showing the Web Animations API ruling over CSS Transitions and Animations as well as a third category representing future animation specs with a question mark.\" width=\"1207\" height=\"781\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"the_two_models_timing_and_animation","title":"The Two Models: Timing and Animation","isH3":false,"content":"<p>The Web Animations API runs on top of two models, one that handles time—Timing—and one that handles visual change over time—Animation.
