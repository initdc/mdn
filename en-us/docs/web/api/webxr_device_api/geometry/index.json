Each object within the scene that needs to directly exchange position and orientation data with the WebXR system needs to be able to report that information in a way that can be understood and adapted as needed to be comprehensible by other objects within the scene.</p>\n<p>In augmented reality (AR), this is because of the need to insert virtual objects into the real world, not only placing them correctly but also ensuring that they don't seem to wander around on their own as the user's perspective shifts. In virtual reality (VR), it's all about creating a sense of space in which the user's movements are precisely matched by the imagery presented on the virtual display, to prevent disjoints and disconnects that could cause discomfort or worse.</p>\n<p>Thus it's all about creating a sense of space. From the perspective of an XR developer, designing the stage is the part that matters most to your users. Like an architect or a set designer, you have the power to create moods and experiences through a physical environment. How you structure that space will both depend on and influence how users can interact and explore it.</p>\n<div class=\"notecard note\" id=\"sect2\">\n  <p><strong>Note:</strong> A space will typically have foreground, mid-distance, and background elements. The right balance can create a unique presence and guide your user. The foreground includes objects and interfaces that you can interact with directly. The mid-distance includes objects you can interact with to some extent, or can approach in order to examine and engage with more closely. The background, on the other hand, is usually largely or entirely non-interactive, at least until and unless the user is able to approach it, bringing it into the mid-distance or foreground range.</p>\n</div>\n<p>In WebXR, the fundamental concept of a <strong>space</strong>—as in, a coordinate space in which a scene takes place—is represented by an instance of <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRSpace\"><code>XRSpace</code></a>. The space is used to make determinations about the relative positions and motion of objects and other entities (such as light sources and cameras) within the user's environment.</p>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, any given 3D point consists of three components, each identifying the distance from the center of the space along one of the three axes.</p>\n<p>This is the <strong>native origin</strong> of the space, corresponding to a specific physical location in the user's environment. Each space has its own native origin, which is tracked by the XR device's tracking system. This may be different from the <strong>effective origin</strong>, which is the origin point for the space's local coordinate system.</p>\n<p>The directionality of the coordinate system can be seen in the following diagram:</p>\n<p>\n  <img src=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Geometry/webgl_coordinates.svg\" alt=\"Diagram showing the coordinate system used by WebGL and WebXR.\" width=\"487\" height=\"487\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</p>\n<p>An <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRRigidTransform\"><code>XRRigidTransform</code></a> called the <strong>origin offset</strong> is used to transform points from the space's own effective coordinate system to the XR device's native coordinate system. The origin offset is initially an identity transform, since typically the two origins are aligned when the space is first established. However, as changes in alignment accumulate over time the origin offset may change to compensate.</p>\n<p>The position of a point in space relative to the origin is determined by determining its distance along each of the three spatial axes shown in the diagram above. The space's origin is the point (0, 0, 0), at the center of the space and at the zero position along each axis. Specifically, under the initial starting conditions, with the default orientation of the viewer upon the space:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The <strong>x-axis</strong> extends horizontally from left to right away from the origin, with the <em>x</em> coordinate of +1.0 being located at the right edge of the world. Negative values of <em>x</em> extend toward the left from the origin, reaching a value of -1.0 at the left edge of the space.</li>\n  <li>The <strong>y-axis</strong> is positive extending upward from the origin toward the top of the screen, reaching +1.0 at the top of the world space. Values of <em>y</em> less than 0 are found below the origin, extending toward the bottom of the screen and reaching -1.0 at the bottom of the world's space.</li>\n  <li>The <strong>z-axis</strong> extends from the origin outward from the screen, reaching +1.0 at the closest point to the user in that direction. Negative values of <em>z</em> extend away from the user further into the screen, with the farthest away point in the world having a <em>z</em> of -1.0.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Every object is, at the simplest level, a set of polygons defined by points in 3D space and an offset transform, indicating how to move and rotate the object to position it at the desired point in space. If the offset transform is an identity matrix, the object is located at the origin point.</p>\n<p>To be useful for spatial tracking and scene geometry, though, you need to be able to correlate the XR device's perceived position with the space's coordinate system.

Instead, the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API\">WebXR Device API</a> is designed to have developers plan their users' experiences and request an appropriate reference space that best represents those needs. This is done by asking the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent\">user agent</a> for an <strong><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRReferenceSpace\"><code>XRReferenceSpace</code></a></strong> matching those needs.</p>\n<p>An <code>XRReferenceSpace</code> object acts as a means to adapt one coordinate system reference frame to another. After putting on a headset, consider the virtual world around you to have a coordinate system in which your position is (0, 0, 0)—that is, you're at the center of everything. Doesn't that feel empowering? Forward, directly in front of your headset, is the -Z axis, with +Z behind you. X is positive to your right and negative to your left. Y is negative as you go downward and positive as you go upward. This indicates the position of the headset in space at the start of your use of the XR system, with the origin (0, 0, 0) being positioned basically at the bridge of your nose. This space is the <strong>world space</strong>.</p>\n<p>Next, consider the XR controller you have in your left hand. It has the ability to report movement and its orientation, but it doesn't know anything about the position of the headset or, more crucially, its coordinate system. But the controller still needs a way to report its position to your app. Thus, it has its own coordinate system. This is a reference space which is provided to your app when input events occur. This reference space internally knows how to map the coordinates of the controller to the headset's coordinates, so WebXR can translate coordinates back and forth for you.</p>\n<p>Once created, an <code>XRReferenceSpace</code> guarantees a certain level of support for motion and orientation tracking, and provides a mechanism for obtaining an <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRViewerPose\"><code>XRViewerPose</code></a> from which you can get a matrix which represents the position and facing direction of the space relative to the world space, if the space represents a viewer such as the user's headset, an observer's headset, or a virtual camera.</p>\n<p>All of this is the browser's responsibility to handle, providing consistent behavior regardless of how capable each of the underlying reference spaces are.
