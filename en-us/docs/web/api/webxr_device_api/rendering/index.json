When your callback returns, the browser transfers that backbuffer to the display or XR device, along with anything else that's changed since the last time the screen was refreshed.</p>\n<p>Historically, displays have refreshed 60 times per second. This is due to early displays using the AC electrical grid's current flow waveform, which cycles 60 times per second in the United States (50 in Europe), for timing purposes. This figure goes by a number of different names, but they're all equivalent or nearly so:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Refresh rate</li>\n  <li>Vertical refresh rate</li>\n  <li>Vertical blanking rate (VBL)</li>\n  <li>Vertical sync rate</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are other similar terms used as well, but regardless of what it's called, the unit of measurement applied is the Hertz, or Hz. A display that refreshes 60 times per second has a 60 Hz refresh rate. That means that the maximum number of frames it can display in a second is 60. No matter how many frames per second you render beyond that, only 60 of them will make it to the screen in the course of a second.</p>\n<p>But not all displays run at 60 Hz; nowadays, higher performance displays are beginning to use much higher refresh rates. 120 Hz—or 120 frame per second—displays are increasingly common, for example. The browser always tries to refresh at the same rate as the display, which means that on some computers, your callback will be run a maximum of 60 times per second, while on others it might be called 90 or 120 times per second or even more, depending on the frame rate.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"time_available_to_render_each_frame","title":"Time available to render each frame","isH3":true,"content":"<p>This makes using the most of the time available between frames critical. If the user's device is using a 60 Hz display, your callback will be called up to 60 times per second, and your goal is to do what you can to ensure that it doesn't get called less often than that. You achieve this by doing as much as is practicable off the main thread and by keeping your frame rendering callback as efficient as possible. The division of time into 60 Hz blocks with each block being used at least in part to render the scene is shown in the diagram below.</p>\n<p>\n  <img src=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Rendering/frames-and-refresh-rate.svg\" alt=\"Renderer execution time per frame period\" width=\"881\" height=\"179\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</p>\n<p>This is important because as the computer becomes increasingly busy, it may not be able to accurately call your callback every frame and may have to skip frames. This is called <strong>dropping frames</strong>. This happens when the amount of time it takes to render a frame exceeds the time available between frames, whether because rendering was delayed or because rendering itself took more time than was available.</p>\n<p>\n  <img src=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Rendering/dropped-frames-timing.svg\" alt=\"Renderer execution time per frame period\" width=\"881\" height=\"198\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</p>\n<p>In the diagram above, frame 3 is dropped because frame 2 did not complete rendering until after frame 3 was due to be painted. The next frame drawn will be frame 4 instead. This is another reason the timestamp passed into your rendering callback is useful. By configuring the scene based on time rather than frame number, you can ensure your rendered frames match what's expected instead of falling behind.</p>\n<p>When a frame is dropped, the contents of the affected display area don't change for that pass through the frame loop. For that reason, the occasional dropped frame isn't usually particularly noticeable, but if it starts to happen a lot—especially if several frames are dropped in a very short span of time—it can become jarring or even leave your display unusable.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, you can easily compute how much time you're allowed to use between frames as <code>1/refreshRate</code> seconds. That is, by dividing 1 by the display's refresh rate. The resulting value is the amount of time available for each frame to be rendered in order to not drop the frame. For example, a 60 Hz display has 1/60th of a second to render a single frame, or 0.0166667 seconds. And if the device's refresh rate is 120 Hz, you only have 0.00883333 seconds to render each frame if you want to avoid dropping frames.</p>\n<p>Even if the hardware is actually 120 Hz, though, you can get by with just refreshing 60 times per second anyway, and targeting that is usually a good baseline to follow. 60 FPS is already beyond the point at which most people can easily detect that the animation isn't a series of still images going by really fast. In other words, when in doubt, you can assume that the display is refreshing at 60 Hz. As long as your code is written properly, everything will be fine.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"renderer_performance_concerns","title":"Renderer performance concerns","isH3":true,"content":"<p>Clearly, you have very little time to render your scene each frame. Not only that, but if your renderer itself runs longer than that amount of time, you can cause not just the frame to get dropped, but that time to be wasted entirely, blocking other code from getting to run at all for that frame.</p>\n<p>Not only that, but if your rendering crosses the vertical refresh boundary, you can wind up with a <strong>tearing</strong> effect. Tearing occurs when the display hardware starts the next refresh cycle while the previous frame is still being drawn to the screen. As a result, you wind up with the visual effect of the top part of the screen showing the new frame, while the bottom part of the frame shows some combination of the previous frame and possibly even the frame before that one.</p>\n<p>Your mission, then, is to keep your code tight and lightweight enough that you don't overrun the time available to you or otherwise cause dropped frames or excessively abuse the main thread.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, unless your renderer is fairly small and lightweight, with little to do, you should consider offloading everything you can to a worker so you can be computing the next frame while the browser handles other things. By having your computations and data ready before the frame is actually called for, you can make your site or app render much more efficiently, improving main thread performance and generally making the user experience better.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there are some tricks you can use to further reduce your impact and optimize performance if your rendering needs are particularly heavy.

Since they're a known, fixed distance apart, our brains can do basic geometry and trigonometry and figure out the 3D nature of reality from that information. We also make use of perspective, size differences, and even our understanding of how things usually look to figure out the details of that third dimension. These factors, among others, are the source of our <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_perception\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">depth perception</a>.</p>\n<p>To create the illusion of three dimensions when rendering graphics, we need to simulate as many of these factors as we can. The more of these we simulate—and the more accurately we do so—the better we are able to trick the human brain into perceiving our images in 3D. The advantage to XR is that not only can we use the classic monocular techniques to simulate 3D graphics (perspective, size, and simulated parallax), but we can also simulate binocular vision—that is, vision using two eyes—by rendering the scene twice for each frame of animation—once for each eye.</p>\n<p>The typical human's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupillary_distance\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">pupillary distance</a>—the distance between the centers of the pupils—is between 54 and 74 millimeters (0.054 to 0.074 meters). So if the center of the viewer's head is located at <code>[0.0, 2.0, 0.0]</code> (about two meters above ground level at the center of the space horizontally), we first need to render the scene from, say, <code>[-0.032, 2.0, 0.0]</code> (32mm to the left of center) and then render it again at <code>[0.032, 2.0, 0.0]</code> (32mm right of center.) This way, we place the positions of the viewer's eyes at an average human pupillary distance of 64mm.</p>\n<p>That distance (or whatever pupillary distance the XR system is configured to use) is enough to allow our minds to see just enough difference due to retinal disparity (the difference in what each retina sees) and the parallax effect to allow our brains to calculate the distance to and depth of objects, thus enabling us to perceive three dimensions despite our retinas only being 2D surfaces.</p>\n<p>This is illustrated in the diagram below, in which we see how each eye perceives a die located directly in front of the viewer. While this diagram exaggerates the effect in some respects for illustrative purposes, the concept is the same. Each eye sees an area whose boundaries make up an arc in front of the eye. Because each eye is offset to one side or the other of the head's centerline, and each eye sees about the same field of view, the result is that each eye sees a slightly different part of the world in front of it, and from a slightly different angle.</p>\n<p>\n  <img src=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Rendering/binocular-vision.svg\" alt=\"Diagram showing how binocular vision works\" width=\"550\" height=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</p>\n<p>The left eye sees the die from a little bit to the left of center, and the right eye sees it from a bit to the right of center. As a result, the left eye sees just a little bit more of the left side of the object and a little bit less of the right, and vice versa. These two images are focused onto the retinas and the resulting signal transmitted over the optic nerves to the brain's visual cortex, located at the back of the occipital lobe.</p>\n<p>The brain takes those signals from the left and right eyes and constructs a single, unified, 3D image of the world in the viewer's brain, and that image is what is seen. And because of those differences between what is seen by the left eye versus the right eye, the brain is able to infer a great deal of information about how deep the object is, its size, and more. By combining that inferred depth information with other cues such as perspective, shadows, memories of what these relationships mean, and so forth, we can figure out a great deal about the world around us.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"frames_poses_views_and_framebuffers","title":"Frames, poses, views, and framebuffers","isH3":true,"content":"<p>Once you have an <code>XRFrame</code> representing the state of the scene at a moment in time, you need to determine the positions of objects within the scene relative to the viewer so that you can render them.

href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRSession\"><code>XRSession</code></a> from the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRFrame\"><code>XRFrame</code></a> object specified by the <code>frame</code> parameter, then calls the session's <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRSession/requestAnimationFrame\" title=\"requestAnimationFrame()\"><code>requestAnimationFrame()</code></a> method to immediately schedule the rendering of the next frame. This ensures we get into the queue right away, allowing the rest of the time spent in this iteration of the <code>myDrawFrame()</code> function to count toward the timing of drawing the next frame.</p>\n<p>We then get the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRViewerPose\"><code>XRViewerPose</code></a> object that describes the viewer's pose—their position and orientation—using the frame's <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRFrame/getViewerPose\" title=\"getViewerPose()\"><code>getViewerPose()</code></a> method, passing in the viewer's reference space from the <code>viewerRefSpace</code> previously obtained <a href=\"#preparing_the_renderer\">while setting up the WebXR session</a>.</p>\n<p>With the viewer's pose in hand, we can then begin to render the frame. The first step is to obtain access to the framebuffer into which the WebXR device wants the frame drawn; this is done by getting the target WebGL layer from the session's <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRSession/renderState\" title=\"renderState\"><code>renderState</code></a> object's <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRRenderState/baseLayer\" title=\"baseLayer\"><code>baseLayer</code></a> property, then getting the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRWebGLLayer/framebuffer\" title=\"framebuffer\"><code>framebuffer</code></a> from that <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRWebGLLayer\"><code>XRWebGLLayer</code></a> object. We then call <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/bindFramebuffer\"><code>gl.bindFrameBuffer()</code></a> to bind that framebuffer as the target for all upcoming drawing commands.</p>\n<p>The next step is to erase the framebuffer. While you can in theory skip this step—<em>if and only if your rendering code is guaranteed to write every single pixel in the framebuffer</em>—it's generally safest to just go ahead and clear it before you begin to draw, unless you need to eke out every ounce of performance you can and know you're touching all the pixels anyway. The background color is set to fully opaque black using <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/clearColor\"><code>gl.clearColor()</code></a>; the clear depth is set to 1.0 by calling <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/clearDepth\"><code>gl.cleardepth()</code></a>, in order to clear all pixels regardless of how far away the object they're part of is; and finally, the frame's pixel and depth buffers are both erased by calling <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/clear\"><code>gl.clear()</code></a>, passing in a bit mask in which both <code>COLOR_BUFFER_BIT</code> and <code>DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT</code> are set.</p>\n<p>Since WebXR uses a single framebuffer for every view, with viewports upon the view being used to separate each eye's viewpoint within the framebuffer, we only need to clear a single framebuffer rather than cleaning it for each eye (or other viewpoints, if any) individually.</p>\n<p>Next, the time elapsed since the previous frame was rendered is calculated by subtracting from the current time as specified by the <code>currentFrameTime</code> parameter the saved time at which the last frame was rendered, <code>lastFrameTime</code>. The result is a <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp\"><code>DOMHighResTimeStamp</code></a> value indicating the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since the last frame was rendered. We can use this value while drawing the scene to ensure we move everything the appropriate distance given the true elapsed time, rather than assuming that the callback will be fired at a consistent frame rate. This elapsed time is saved in the variable <code>deltaTime</code>, and the value of <code>lastFrameTime</code> is replaced with this frame's time, ready to compute the differential for the next frame.</p>\n<p>It's now time to actually render the scene for each eye. We iterate over the views within the viewer poses's <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRViewerPose/views\" title=\"views\"><code>views</code></a> array. For each of these <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRView\"><code>XRView</code></a> objects representing an eye's perspective on the scene, we need to begin by limiting drawing to the area of the framebuffer which represents the current eye's visible image.</p>\n<p>We begin by preparing WebGL to render the eye's contents by getting the viewport that restricts drawing to the area within the framebuffer that's reserved for the current eye's image by calling the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRWebGLLayer\"><code>XRWebGLLayer</code></a> method <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRWebGLLayer/getViewport\" title=\"getViewport()\"><code>getViewport()</code></a>. We then set the WebGL viewport to match, passing in the X and Y origin of the viewport along with its width and height into <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/viewport\"><code>gl.viewport()</code></a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, we call our method <code>myDrawSceneIntoView()</code> to actually use WebGL to render the scene. Into this, we pass the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRView\"><code>XRView</code></a> representing the eye we're drawing for (in order to perform perspective mapping and the like) and <code>deltaTime</code>, so the scene drawing code can accurately represent the elapsed time when determining the positions of objects moving over time.</p>\n<p>When the loop that's iterating over the views ends, every image required to represent the scene to the viewer has been rendered, and upon return, the framebuffer makes its way through the GPU and eventually to the XR device's display or displays. Since we called <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRSession/requestAnimationFrame\" title=\"requestAnimationFrame()\"><code>requestAnimationFrame()</code></a> at the top of the function, our callback will be invoked once again when it's time to render the next frame of the scene's animation.</p>\n<h4 id=\"drawbacks_to_this_approach\">Drawbacks to this approach</h4>\n<p>Since it's important to minimize how much time you spend in this function as much as possible, the more time you spend handling state changes, the less time you have to actually draw things. This technique works very well for a small number of objects, but because it has to re-bind all the data for each object twice (once for the left eye, and once for the right), you're spending a lot of time adjusting the state, uploading buffers and textures, and so forth. In the next section, we look at an altered approach that reduces these state changes substantially, providing a potentially much faster rendering approach, especially as your object count goes up.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"optimizing_by_rendering_in_object-first_order","title":"Optimizing by rendering in object-first order","isH3":true,"content":"<p>An advantage of WebXR's approach of using a single WebGL framebuffer to contain both the left and right eye's views in a single framebuffer makes it possible to substantially improve rendering performance by rearranging the order in which things are done. Instead of setting up the viewport for a given view (such as the left eye), then rendering every object visible to the left eye, one by one, reconfiguring buffers for each object as you go, you can instead render each object twice in a row, once for each eye, thereby only needing to set up the buffers, uniforms, and so forth once for both eyes.</p>\n<p>The resulting pseudocode looks like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"notranslate\">for each object in the scene\n  bindProgram()\n  bindUniforms()\n  bindBuffers()\n  bindTextures()\n  for each view in the pose's views list\n    get the XRWebGLLayer's viewport\n    set the WebGL viewport to match\n    bindVertices()\n    bindMatrices()\n    drawMyObject()\n</pre>\n<p>By changing things up in this way, we only bind programs, uniforms, buffers, textures, and potentially other things once per frame instead of twice for each object found in the scene.

This <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp\"><code>DOMHighResTimeStamp</code></a> value is a floating-point value indicating the time at which the frame was scheduled for rendering. Because the execution of your callback is not going to happen at precise 1/60th of a second intervals—and, indeed, could happen at other rates if the user's display has a different frame rate—you can't rely on the simple fact that your code is running to assume that it's been 1/60th of a second since the last frame.</p>\n<p>For that reason, you need to use the timestamp provided to ensure your animation renders at precisely the desired speed. To do so, the first thing you need to do is to compute the time that has elapsed since the last frame was rendered:</p>\n<div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: js notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> lastFrameTime <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">drawFrame</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">time<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> frame</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token comment\">// schedule next frame, prepare the buffer, etc.</span>\n\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> deltaTime <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>time <span class=\"token operator\">-</span> lastFrameTime<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">*</span> <span class=\"token number\">0.001</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  lastFrameTime <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> time<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">for</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> view <span class=\"token keyword\">of</span> pose<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>views<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\">/* render each view */</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This maintains a global (or an object property) called <code>lastFrameTime</code> which contains the previous frame's time of rendering. In this case, since the time values are stored in milliseconds, we multiply by 0.001 to convert the time into seconds. In some cases, this saves time later. In other situations, you need the time in milliseconds, so you wouldn't need to change anything.</p>\n<p>With the elapsed time in hand, your rendering code has the means to compute just how much every moving object has moved in the time elapsed. For instance, if an object is rotating, you might apply the rotation like this:</p>\n<div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: js notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> xDeltaRotation <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>xRotationDegreesPerSecond <span class=\"token operator\">*</span> <span class=\"token constant\">RADIANS_PER_DEGREE</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">*</span> deltaTime<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> yDeltaRotation <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>yRotationDegreesPerSecond <span class=\"token operator\">*</span> <span class=\"token constant\">RADIANS_PER_DEGREE</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">*</span> deltaTime<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> zDeltaRotation <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>zRotationDegreesPerSecond <span class=\"token operator\">*</span> <span class=\"token constant\">RADIANS_PER_DEGREE</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">*</span> deltaTime<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This computes the amount by which the object has rotated around each of the three axes since the last time the frame was drawn. Without this, the shape would rotate by the given amount every frame, regardless of the elapsed time. This could cause substantial stutter in many cases.</p>\n<p>The same concept applied for objects that are moving rather than rotating:</p>\n<div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: js notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> xDistanceMoved <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> xSpeedPerSecond <span class=\"token operator\">*</span> deltaTime<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> yDistanceMoved <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> ySpeedPerSecond <span class=\"token operator\">*</span> deltaTime<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> ZDistanceMoved <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> zSpeedPerSecond <span class=\"token operator\">*</span> deltaTime<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p><code>xSpeedPerSecond</code>, <code>ySpeedPerSecond</code>, and <code>zSpeedPerSecond</code> each contain that axis's component of the object's velocity.
