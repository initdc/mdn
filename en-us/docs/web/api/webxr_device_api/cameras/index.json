Since there is no camera, we have to find a way to fake it. Fortunately, physicists like Galileo, Newton, Lorentz, and Einstein have given us the <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_relativity\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">principle of relativity</a></strong>, which states that the laws of physics have the same form in every frame of reference.

There is no way for either of you to see the difference. A third party can tell the difference, but the two of you cannot. If you are a camera, you can achieve the same visual result both by moving the camera <em>or by moving everything around the camera</em>.</p>\n<p>And that's our solution. Since we can't move the camera, we move the world around it. Our renderer needs to know where we imagine the camera to be, then alter the position of every visible object to simulate that position and orientation. Thus, instead of referring to an actual camera object, the term <strong>camera</strong> is used in WebGL and WebXR programming to refer to an object describing the position and viewing direction of a hypothetical viewer of the scene, whether there's an actual object present in 3D space or not.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"points_of_view","title":"Points of view","isH3":true,"content":"<p>Since the camera is a virtual object which, rather than necessarily representing a physical object in the virtual world, represents a viewer's position and viewing direction, it's useful to think about the kinds of situation that call for the use of a camera. Gaming-related situations are listed separately since they are often a special case specific to gaming, but any of these perspectives might apply to any 3D graphics scene.</p>\n<h4 id=\"generalized_cameras\">Generalized cameras</h4>\n<p>In general, virtual cameras may or may not be incorporated into physical objects within the scene. Indeed, outside the scope of 3D gaming, the odds are far more likely that the camera will not correspond with an object that appears in the scene at all. Some examples of ways 3D cameras are used:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>When rendering animation—whether for filmmaking or for use within the context of a presentation or game—the virtual camera is used just like a real-world film camera. As much as possible, <a href=\"#simulating_classic_cinematography\">standard cinematographic techniques</a> are used, since the viewer has likely grown up watching films using those techniques, and has subconscious expectations that a film or animation will follow those methods. Deviating from them can pull the viewer out of the moment.</li>\n  <li>In business applications, the 3D camera is used to set the apparent size and perspective when rendering things such as graphs and charts.</li>\n  <li>In mapping applications, the camera may either be placed directly over the scene, or might use various angles to show perspective. For 3D GPS solutions, the camera is positioned to show the area around the user, with the majority of the display showing the area ahead of the user's path of motion.</li>\n  <li>When using WebGL to accelerate 2D graphics drawing, the camera is typically placed directly above the center of the scene with the distance and field of view set to allow the entire scene to be presented.</li>\n  <li>When accelerating bitmapped graphics, the renderer would draw the 2D image into a WebGL texture's buffer, then redraw the texture to refresh the screen. This essentially uses the texture as a backbuffer for performing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_buffering\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">multiple buffering</a> in your 2D graphics application.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"cameras_in_gaming\">Cameras in gaming</h4>\n<p>There are many kinds of games, and as such, there are several ways in which cameras might be used in games. Some common situations include:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>In a first-person game, the camera is located within the player's avatar's head, facing in the same direction as the avatar's eyes. This way, the view presented on the player's screen or headset is what their avatar would be seeing.</li>\n  <li>In some third-person games, the camera is located a short distance behind the player's avatar or vehicle, showing them from behind as they move through the game world. This is used in a lot of multiplayer online role-playing games, certain shooter games, and so forth. Popular examples include <em>World of Warcraft</em>, <em>Tomb Raider</em>, and <em>Fortnite</em>. This category also includes games where the camera is placed just over the player's shoulder.</li>\n  <li>Some 3D games offer the ability to change your point of view, such as to look out the various windows of an aircraft in a flight simulator, or to see the views from all the security cameras within the game level (a common feature of spy and stealth-based games). This ability is also used by games offering weapons with scopes, where the view isn't quite based off the head's position in the same way anymore.</li>\n  <li>3D games might also provide the ability for non-players to observe the action, either by positioning an invisible avatar of sorts or by choosing a fixed virtual camera to watch from.</li>\n  <li>In advanced 3D games, a camera or camera-like object <em>could</em> be used to determine what a non-player character can see, relying on the same rendering and physics engine used by player characters for non-player characters.</li>\n  <li>In single-screen 2D games, the camera is not associated directly with the player or any other character in the game, but is instead either fixed above or next to the game play area, or follows the action as the action moves around a scrolling game world. For example, a classic arcade game such as <em>Pac-Man</em> takes place on a fixed game map, so the camera remains fixed a set distance above the map, always pointed straight down at the game world.</li>\n  <li>In a side-scrolling or top-scrolling game such as <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, the camera moves along left and right (or up and down, or both) to ensure that the action remains visible even though the game level is much larger than the viewport.</li>\n</ul>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"positioning_the_camera","title":"Positioning the camera","isH3":true,"content":"<p>Since there are no standard camera objects in WebGL or WebXR, we need to simulate the camera ourselves. Before we can do so, and before we can then simulate the movement of the camera, let's actually take a look at the virtual camera and how it <em>can</em> move, at the most fundamental level. As in all things, the <strong>position</strong> of an object in space—even if that space if virtual—can be represented using three numbers that indicate its position relative to the origin, whose position is defined to be (0, 0, 0).</p>\n<p>There's another aspect of the spatial relationship of an object to the origin in space left to be considered: <strong>perspective</strong>. Perspective, properly applied to the objects in a scene, can take a scene that would otherwise look as flat as a typical 2D screen and make it pop as if it were truly 3D. There are several kinds of perspective; those are defined and their mathematics explained in the article <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/WebGL_model_view_projection\">WebGL model view projection</a>. Importantly, the effect of perspective on a vector can be represented by adding a fourth component to the vector: the perspective component, called <code>w</code>.</p>\n<p>The value of <code>w</code> is applied by dividing each of the other three components by it to get the final position or vector; that is, for a coordinate given as (<code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>z</code>, <code>w</code>), the point in the 3D space is actually (<code>x</code>/<code>w</code>, <code>y</code>/<code>w</code>, <code>z</code>/<code>w</code>, 1) or (<code>x</code>/<code>w</code>, <code>y</code>/<code>w</code>, <code>z</code>/<code>w</code>). If you're not using perspective, <code>w</code> is always 1. In that situation, the complete coordinates for an object located at (1, 0, 3) are (1, 0, 3, 1).</p>\n<p>But the location isn't enough to describe an object in 3D space because an object's state in space isn't only about its location, but about its rotation or facing direction, otherwise known as its <strong>orientation</strong>. The orientation can be represented using a 3D vector, which is typically normalized so that its length is 1.0. For example, if the object is facing an object located at (3, 1, -2)—that is, three meters to the right, one meter up, and two meters away from the origin point—the result is:</p>\n<p>\n  <math display=\"block\">\n    <semantics>\n      <mrow>\n        <mo>[</mo>\n        <mtable rowspacing=\"0.5ex\">\n          <mtr>\n            <mtd>\n              <mn>3</mn>\n            </mtd>\n          </mtr>\n          <mtr>\n            <mtd>\n              <mn>1</mn>\n            </mtd>\n          </mtr>\n          <mtr>\n            <mtd>\n              <mo>-</mo>\n              <mn>2</mn>\n            </mtd>\n          </mtr>\n        </mtable>\n        <mo>]</mo>\n      </mrow>\n      <annotation encoding=\"TeX\">\\left [ \\begin{matrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ -2 \\end{matrix} \\right ]</annotation>\n    </semantics>\n  </math>\n</p>\n<p>This can also be represented as an array:</p>\n<div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: js notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> directionVector <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">3</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token operator\">-</span><span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>For the purposes of performing operations involving both the coordinates and the facing direction vector, the vector needs to include the <code>w</code> component. The value of <code>w</code> is always 0 for vectors, so the aforementioned vector can also be represented using <code>[3, 1, -2, 0]</code> or:</p>\n<p>\n  <math display=\"block\">\n    <semantics>\n      <mrow>\n        <mo>[</mo>\n        <mtable rowspacing=\"0.5ex\">\n          <mtr>\n            <mtd>\n              <mn>3</mn>\n            </mtd>\n          </mtr>\n          <mtr>\n            <mtd>\n              <mn>1</mn>\n            </mtd>\n          </mtr>\n          <mtr>\n            <mtd>\n              <mo>-</mo>\n              <mn>2</mn>\n            </mtd>\n          </mtr>\n          <mtr>\n            <mtd>\n              <mn>0</mn>\n            </mtd>\n          </mtr>\n        </mtable>\n        <mo>]</mo>\n      </mrow>\n      <annotation encoding=\"TeX\">\\left [ \\begin{matrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ -2 \\ 0 \\end{matrix} \\right ]</annotation>\n    </semantics>\n  </math>\n</p>\n<p>WebXR automatically normalizes vectors to have a length of 1 meter; however, you may find that it makes sense to do it yourself for various reasons, such as to improve performance of calculations by not having to repeatedly perform normalization.</p>\n<p>Once you've determined the matrix representing the combination of movements you wish the camera to make, you need to reverse it, because you're not moving the camera. Since you're actually moving everything <em>except</em> the camera, take the inverse of the transform matrix to get an inverse transform matrix. This inverse matrix can then be applied to the objects in the world to alter their positions and orientations to simulate the desired camera position.</p>\n<p>This is why the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRRigidTransform\"><code>XRRigidTransform</code></a> object used by WebXR to represent transforms includes an <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRRigidTransform/inverse\" title=\"inverse\"><code>inverse</code></a> property. The <code>inverse</code> property is another <code>XRRigidTransform</code> object which is the inverse of the parent transform. Since the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRView\"><code>XRView</code></a> representing the view has a <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRView/transform\" title=\"transform\"><code>transform</code></a> property which is an <code>XRRigidTransform</code> providing the camera view, you can get the model view matrix—the transform matrix needed to move the world to simulate the desired camera position—like this:</p>\n<div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: js notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> viewMatrix <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> view<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>transform<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>inverse<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>matrix<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>If the library you're using accepts an <code>XRRigidTransform</code> object directly, you can instead get <code>view.transform.inverse</code>, rather than pulling out just the array representing the view matrix.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"composing_multiple_transforms","title":"Composing multiple transforms","isH3":true,"content":"<p>If your camera needs to be performing multiple transforms simultaneously, such as zooming and panning at the same time, you can multiply the transform matrices together to compose them into a single matrix that applies both changes at once.

Zooming is performed in a physical camera by altering the focal length of the lens; this is the distance between the center of the lens itself and the camera's light sensors. Thus, zooming doesn't actually involve moving the camera at all. Instead, a zoom shot changes the magnification of the camera over time to make the area of focus seem closer to or farther away from the viewer, without actually physically moving the camera. A slow move can bring a sense of movement, ease, or focus to a scene, while a rapid zoom can create a sense of anxiety, surprise, or tension.</p>\n<p>Because a zoom does not move the camera's position, the resulting effect is unnatural. The human eye doesn't have a zoom lens on it. We make things smaller or larger by moving away from or toward them. In cinematography, that's called a <a href=\"#dollying_moving_in_or_out\">dolly shot</a>.</p>\n<p>There are two techniques in 3D graphics that can create similar though not identical results, and whose methods apply more easily in different situations.</p>\n<h4 id=\"zooming_by_adjusting_field_of_view\">Zooming by adjusting field of view</h4>\n<p>You can do something more akin to a true \"zoom\" by altering the camera's <strong>field of view</strong> (<strong>FOV</strong>). The field of view is an angle defining the length of the arc on the entire viewable area surrounding the camera that should be visible at once. This is an effect of the focal length in a physical camera, so since there is no true camera, altering the FOV is a passable substitute.</p>\n<p>Recall that the circumference of a circle is 2π⋅r radians (360°); as such, this is the theoretical maximum FOV. Realistically, though, not only do humans not see anywhere near that much, but viewing devices such as monitors and VR goggles tend to reduce the field of view even further. Human eyes typically have a horizontal field of view of around 135° (about 2.356 radians) and a vertical FOV of about 180° (π or around 3.142 radians).</p>\n<p>Making the camera's FOV smaller reduces the arc that will be included in the viewport, thus enlarging that content when rendered to the view. There are differences between this and an optical zoom effect, but the result is generally close enough to get the job done.</p>\n<p>The following function returns a projection perspective matrix that integrates the specified field of view angle as well as the given near and far clipping plane distances:</p>\n<div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: js notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">createPerspectiveMatrix</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">viewport<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> fovDegrees<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> nearClip<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> farClip</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> fovRadians <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> fovDegrees <span class=\"token operator\">*</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>Math<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token constant\">PI</span> <span class=\"token operator\">/</span> <span class=\"token number\">180.0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> aspectRatio <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> viewport<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>width <span class=\"token operator\">/</span> viewport<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>height<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> transform <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> mat4<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">create</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  mat4<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">perspective</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>transform<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> fovRadians<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> aspectRatio<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n                   nearClip<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> farClip<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> transform<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>After converting the FOV angle, <code>fovDegrees</code>, from degrees to radians and computing the aspect ratio of the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRViewport\"><code>XRViewport</code></a> specified by the <code>viewport</code> parameter, this function uses the <a href=\"https://glmatrix.net/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">glMatrix</a> library's <a href=\"https://glmatrix.net/docs/module-mat4.html#.perspective\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\"><code>mat4.perspective()</code></a> function to compute the perspective matrix.</p>\n<p>The perspective matrix encapsulates the field of view (technically, this is the <em>vertical</em> field of view), aspect ratio, and the near and far clipping planes within the 4x4 matrix <code>transform</code>, which is then returned to the caller.</p>\n<p>The near clipping plane is the distance in meters to a plane parallel to the display surface closer than which nothing gets drawn. Any vertices which lie on the same side of that plane as the camera are not drawn. Conversely, the far clipping plane is the distance in meters to a plane beyond which no vertices are drawn.</p>\n<p>To zoom using a scaling factor or percentage, you can map 1x (100% of normal size) to the largest value of FOV you allow (which leads to the most content being visible), then map your maximum magnification to the maximum value of FOV you support and map corresponding values in between.</p>\n<p>If you start each frame's rendering pass by computing the perspective matrix, you can then multiply into that matrix all the other transforms you need to apply in order to result in the frame's desired geometry.

These may or may not necessarily be identical for each axis, though the closest result you can get to a zoom effect would involve using the same value for each. This would need to be applied to every vertex in the scene—ideally in the vertex shader.</p>\n<p>If you want to scale up by a factor of 2, you need to multiply each component by 2.0. To scale down by the same amount, multiply them by -2.0.

If any of these values differs from the others, the result will be stretching or contraction which is different in some dimensions compared to others.</p>\n<p>If the same scaling factor is to be

In this case, we're passing in the WebGL context, <code>gl</code>, the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRView\"><code>XRView</code></a> <code>view</code>, a <code>sceneData</code> object (which contains things like the vertex and fragment shaders, vertex lists, textures, and so forth), and <code>deltaTime</code>, which indicates how much time has passed since the previous frame, so that we know how far to advance the animation.</p>\n<p>When this function returns, the WebGL framebuffer being used by WebXR now has in it two copies of the scene, each occupying half the frame: one for the left eye, and one for the right eye. This makes its way through the XR software and drivers into the headset, where each half is shown to the appropriate eye.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"see_also","title":"See also","isH3":false,"content":"<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Geometry\">Geometry and reference spaces</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/WebGL_model_view_projection\">WebGL model view projection</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/Matrix_math_for_the_web\">Matrix math for the web</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Movement_and_motion\">Movement, orientation, and motion: A WebXR example</a></li>\n</ul>"}}],"toc":[{"text":"Cameras and relative movement","id":"cameras_and_relative_movement"},{"text":"Simulating classic cinematography","id":"simulating_classic_cinematography"},{"text":"Combining movements","id":"combining_movements"},{"text":"Representing 3D with WebXR","id":"representing_3d_with_webxr"},{"text":"See also","id":"see_also"}],"summary":"The first and most important thing to understand when considering the code to manage point-of-view and cameras in your application is this: WebXR does not have cameras. There's no magic object provided by either the WebGL or the WebXR API that represents the viewer that you can rotate and move around to automatically change what's seen on the screen. In this guide we show how use WebGL to simulate camera movements without having a camera to move. These techniques can be used in any WebGL (or WebXR) project.","popularity":0.0002,"modified":"2022-09-20T12:43:24.000Z","other_translations":[{"title":"視点とビューアー: WebXR でのカメラのシミュレーション","locale":"ja","native":"日本語"}],"source":{"folder":"en-us/web/api/webxr_device_api/cameras","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/style/old/files/en-us/web/api/webxr_device_api/cameras/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/51171b417d851dce7d4a08932f0f8db25630d57c","filename":"index.md"},"parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"Web technology for developers"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API","title":"Web APIs"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API","title":"WebXR Device API"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Cameras","title":"Viewpoints and viewers: Simulating cameras in WebXR"}],"pageTitle":"Viewpoints and viewers: Simulating cameras in WebXR - Web APIs | MDN","noIndexing":false}}
