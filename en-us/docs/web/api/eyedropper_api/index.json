The <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/EyeDropper/open\"><code>EyeDropper.prototype.open()</code></a> method can only be called in response to a user action (like a button click).</li>\n  <li>No pixel information can be retrieved without user intent again. The promise returned by <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/EyeDropper/open\"><code>EyeDropper.prototype.open()</code></a> only resolves to a color value in response to a user action (clicking on a pixel). So the eyedropper cannot be used in the background without the user noticing it.</li>\n  <li>To help users notice the eyedropper mode more easily, it is made obvious by browsers. The normal mouse cursor disappears after a short delay and a magnifying glass appears instead. There is also a delay between when the eyedropper mode starts and when the user can select a pixel to ensure the user has had time to see the magnifying glass.</li>\n  <li>Users are also be able to cancel the eyedropper mode at any time (by pressing the <kbd>Escape</kbd> key).</li>\n</ul>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"interfaces","title":"Interfaces","isH3":false,"content":"<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/EyeDropper\"><code>EyeDropper</code></a> <svg class=\"icon icon-experimental\" tabindex=\"0\">\n    <use xlink:href=\"/assets/badges.svg#icon-experimental\"></use>\n</svg></li>\n</ul>"}},{"type":"specifications","value":{"title":"Specifications","id":"specifications","isH3":false,"specifications":[{"bcdSpecificationURL":"https://wicg.github.io/eyedropper-api/#eyedropper-interface","title":"EyeDropper API"}],"query":"api.EyeDropper"}},{"type":"browser_compatibility","value":{"title":"Browser compatibility","id":"browser_compatibility","isH3":false,"query":"api.EyeDropper","dataURL":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/EyeDropper_API/bcd.json"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"see_also","title":"See also","isH3":false,"content":"<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://web.dev/eyedropper/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Picking colors of any pixel on the screen with the EyeDropper API</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/2021/03/media-production-workshop/talks/patrick-brosset-eyedropper-api.html\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">The EyeDropper API W3C/SMPTE Joint Workshop</a></li>\n</ul>"}}],"toc":[{"text":"Concept","id":"concept"},{"text":"Security and privacy measures","id":"security_and_privacy_measures"},{"text":"Interfaces","id":"interfaces"},{"text":"Specifications","id":"specifications"},{"text":"Browser compatibility","id":"browser_compatibility"},{"text":"See also","id":"see_also"}],"summary":"The EyeDropper API provides a mechanism for creating an eyedropper tool.
