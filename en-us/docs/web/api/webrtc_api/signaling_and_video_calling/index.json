A form of discovery and media format negotiation must take place, <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Session_lifetime#establishing_a_connection\">as discussed elsewhere</a>, in order for two devices on different networks to locate one another.

How do we create this server and how does the signaling process actually work?</p>\n<p>First we need the signaling server itself. WebRTC doesn't specify a transport mechanism for the signaling information. You can use anything you like, from <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API\">WebSocket</a> to <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest\"><code>XMLHttpRequest</code></a> to carrier pigeons to exchange the signaling information between the two peers.</p>\n<p>It's important to note that the server doesn't need to understand or interpret the signaling data content. Although it's <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/SDP\">SDP</a>, even this doesn't matter so much: the content of the message going through the signaling server is, in effect, a black box. What does matter is when the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/ICE\">ICE</a> subsystem instructs you to send signaling data to the other peer, you do so, and the other peer knows how to receive this information and deliver it to its own ICE subsystem. All you have to do is channel the information back and forth.

The server supports several message types to handle tasks, such as registering new users, setting usernames, and sending public chat messages.</p>\n<p>To allow the server to support signaling and ICE negotiation, we need to update the code. We'll have to allow directing messages to one specific user instead of broadcasting to all connected users, and ensure unrecognized message types are passed through and delivered, without the server needing to know what they are. This lets us send signaling messages using this same server, instead of needing a separate server.</p>\n<p>Let's take a look at changes we need to make to the chat server to support WebRTC signaling. This is in the file <a href=\"https://github.com/mdn/samples-server/blob/master/s/webrtc-from-chat/chatserver.js\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\"><code>chatserver.js</code></a>.</p>\n<p>First up is the addition of the function <code>sendToOneUser()</code>.

The parameter <code>msgString</code> is a stringified JSON object. We could have made it receive our original message object, but in this example it's more efficient this way. Since the message has already been stringified, we can send it with no further processing. Each entry in <code>connectionArray</code> is a <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket\"><code>WebSocket</code></a> object, so we can just call its <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket/send\" title=\"send()\"><code>send()</code></a> method directly.</p>\n<p>Our original chat demo didn't support sending messages to a specific user. The next task is to update the main WebSocket message handler to support doing so. This involves a change near the end of the <code>\"connection\"</code> message handler:</p>\n<div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: js notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>sendToClients<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> msgString <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token constant\">JSON</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">stringify</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>msg<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>msg<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>target <span class=\"token operator\">&amp;&amp;</span> msg<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>target<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>length <span class=\"token operator\">!==</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token function\">sendToOneUser</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>msg<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>target<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> msgString<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">else</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">for</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> connection <span class=\"token keyword\">of</span> connectionArray<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n      connection<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">send</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>msgString<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This code now looks at the pending message to see if it has a <code>target</code> property. If that property is present, it specifies the username of the client to which the message is to be sent, and we call <code>sendToOneUser()</code> to send the message to them. Otherwise, the message is broadcast to all users by iterating over the connection list, sending the message to each user.</p>\n<p>As the existing code allows the sending of arbitrary message types, no additional changes are required. Our clients can now send messages of unknown types to any specific user, letting them send signaling messages back and forth as desired.</p>\n<p>That's all we need to change on the server side of the equation.

href=\"#starting_a_call\">Starting a call</a>. It starts by creating and configuring an <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection\"><code>RTCPeerConnection</code></a> using our <code>createPeerConnection()</code> function. Then it takes the SDP offer from the received <code>\"video-offer\"</code> message and uses it to create a new <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCSessionDescription\"><code>RTCSessionDescription</code></a> object representing the caller's session description.</p>\n<p>That session description is then passed into <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/setRemoteDescription\" title=\"myPeerConnection.setRemoteDescription()\"><code>myPeerConnection.setRemoteDescription()</code></a>. This establishes the received offer as the description of the remote (caller's) end of the connection. If this is successful, the promise fulfillment handler (in the <code>then()</code> clause) starts the process of getting access to the callee's camera and microphone using <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia\" title=\"getUserMedia()\"><code>getUserMedia()</code></a>, adding the tracks to the connection, and so forth, as we saw previously in <code>invite()</code>.</p>\n<p>Once the answer has been created using <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/createAnswer\" title=\"myPeerConnection.createAnswer()\"><code>myPeerConnection.createAnswer()</code></a>, the description of the local end of the connection is set to the answer's SDP by calling <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/setLocalDescription\" title=\"myPeerConnection.setLocalDescription()\"><code>myPeerConnection.setLocalDescription()</code></a>, then the answer is transmitted through the signaling server to the caller to let them know what the answer is.</p>\n<p>Any errors are caught and passed to <code>handleGetUserMediaError()</code>, described in <a href=\"#handling_getusermedia_errors\">Handling getUserMedia() errors</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"notecard note\" id=\"sect8\">\n  <p><strong>Note:</strong> As is the case with the caller, once the <code>setLocalDescription()</code> fulfillment handler has run, the browser begins firing <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/icecandidate_event\" title=\"icecandidate\"><code>icecandidate</code></a> events that the callee must handle, one for each candidate that needs to be transmitted to the remote peer.</p>\n</div>\n<h5 id=\"sending_ice_candidates\">Sending ICE candidates</h5>\n<p>The ICE negotiation process involves each peer sending candidates to the other, repeatedly, until it runs out of potential ways it can support the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>'s media transport needs. Since ICE doesn't know about your signaling server, your code handles transmission of each candidate in your handler for the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/icecandidate_event\" title=\"icecandidate\"><code>icecandidate</code></a> event.</p>\n<p>Your <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/icecandidate_event\" title=\"onicecandidate\"><code>onicecandidate</code></a> handler receives an event whose <code>candidate</code> property is the SDP describing the candidate (or is <code>null</code> to indicate that the ICE layer has run out of potential configurations to suggest). The contents of <code>candidate</code> are what you need to transmit using your signaling server. Here's our example's implementation:</p>\n<div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: js notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">handleICECandidateEvent</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">event</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>event<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>candidate<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token function\">sendToServer</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n      <span class=\"token literal-property property\">type</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"new-ice-candidate\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n      <span class=\"token literal-property property\">target</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> targetUsername<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n      <span class=\"token literal-property property\">candidate</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> event<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>candidate\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This builds an object containing the candidate, then sends it to the other peer using the <code>sendToServer()</code> function previously described in <a href=\"#sending_messages_to_the_signaling_server\">Sending messages to the signaling server</a>. The message's properties are:</p>\n<dl>\n  <dt id=\"type_4\"><code>type</code></dt>\n  <dd>\n    <p>The message type: <code>\"new-ice-candidate\"</code>.</p>\n  </dd>\n  <dt id=\"target_4\"><code>target</code></dt>\n  <dd>\n    <p>The username the ICE candidate needs to be delivered to. This lets the signaling server route the message.</p>\n  </dd>\n  <dt id=\"candidate_2\"><code>candidate</code></dt>\n  <dd>\n    <p>The SDP representing the candidate the ICE layer wants to transmit to the other peer.</p>\n  </dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The format of this message (as is the case with everything you do when handling signaling) is entirely up to you, depending on your needs; you can provide other information as required.</p>\n<div class=\"notecard note\" id=\"sect9\">\n  <p><strong>Note:</strong> It's important to keep in mind that the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/icecandidate_event\" title=\"icecandidate\"><code>icecandidate</code></a> event is <strong>not</strong> sent when ICE candidates arrive from the other end of the call. Instead, they're sent by your own end of the call so that you can take on the job of transmitting the data over whatever channel you choose. This can be confusing when you're new to WebRTC.</p>\n</div>\n<h5 id=\"receiving_ice_candidates\">Receiving ICE candidates</h5>\n<p>The signaling server delivers each ICE candidate to the destination peer using whatever method it chooses; in our example this is as JSON objects, with a <code>type</code> property containing the string <code>\"new-ice-candidate\"</code>. Our <code>handleNewICECandidateMsg()</code> function is called by our main <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API\">WebSocket</a> incoming message code to handle these messages:</p>\n<div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: js notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">handleNewICECandidateMsg</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">msg</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> candidate <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">RTCIceCandidate</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>msg<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>candidate<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n  myPeerConnection<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">addIceCandidate</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>candidate<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">catch</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>reportError<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This function constructs an <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCIceCandidate\"><code>RTCIceCandidate</code></a> object by passing the received SDP into its constructor, then delivers the candidate to the ICE layer by passing it into <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/addIceCandidate\" title=\"myPeerConnection.addIceCandidate()\"><code>myPeerConnection.addIceCandidate()</code></a>. This hands the fresh ICE candidate to the local ICE layer, and finally, our role in the process of handling this candidate is complete.</p>\n<p>Each peer sends to the other peer a candidate for each possible transport configuration that it believes might be viable for the media being exchanged. At some point, the two peers agree that a given candidate is a good choice and they open the connection and begin to share media. It's important to note, however, that ICE negotiation does <em>not</em> stop once media is flowing. Instead, candidates may still keep being exchanged after the conversation has begun, either while trying to find a better connection method, or because they were already in transport when the peers successfully established their connection.</p>\n<p>In addition, if something happens to cause a change in the streaming scenario, negotiation will begin again, with the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/negotiationneeded_event\" title=\"negotiationneeded\"><code>negotiationneeded</code></a> event being sent to the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection\"><code>RTCPeerConnection</code></a>, and the entire process starts again as described before. This can happen in a variety of situations, including:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Changes in the network status, such as a bandwidth change, transitioning from Wi-Fi to cellular connectivity, or the like.</li>\n  <li>Switching between the front and rear cameras on a phone.</li>\n  <li>A change to the configuration of the stream, such as its resolution or frame rate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 id=\"receiving_new_streams\">Receiving new streams</h5>\n<p>When new tracks are added to the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>— either by calling its <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/addTrack\" title=\"addTrack()\"><code>addTrack()</code></a> method or because of renegotiation of the stream's format—a <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/track_event\" title=\"track\"><code>track</code></a> event is set to the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> for each track added to the connection. Making use of newly added media requires implementing a handler for the <code>track</code> event. A common need is to attach the incoming media to an appropriate HTML element. In our example, we add the track's stream to the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video\"><code>&lt;video&gt;</code></a> element that displays the incoming video:</p>\n<div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: js notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">handleTrackEvent</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">event</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  document<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">getElementById</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"received_video\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>srcObject <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> event<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>streams<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  document<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">getElementById</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"hangup-button\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>disabled <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">false</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The incoming stream is attached to the <code>\"received_video\"</code> <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video\"><code>&lt;video&gt;</code></a> element, and the \"Hang Up\" <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button\"><code>&lt;button&gt;</code></a> element is enabled so the user can hang up the call.</p>\n<p>Once this code has completed, finally the video being sent by the other peer is displayed in the local browser window!</p>\n<h5 id=\"handling_the_removal_of_tracks\">Handling the removal of tracks</h5>\n<p>Your code receives a <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream/removetrack_event\" title=\"removetrack\"><code>removetrack</code></a> event when the remote peer removes a track from the connection by calling <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/removeTrack\"><code>RTCPeerConnection.removeTrack()</code></a>.

In any case, all good things must come to an end.</p>\n<h5 id=\"hanging_up\">Hanging up</h5>\n<p>When the user clicks the \"Hang Up\" button to end the call, the <code>hangUpCall()</code> function is called:</p>\n<div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: js notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">hangUpCall</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token function\">closeVideoCall</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token function\">sendToServer</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token literal-property property\">name</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> myUsername<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token literal-property property\">target</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> targetUsername<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token literal-property property\">type</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"hang-up\"</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p><code>hangUpCall()</code> executes <code>closeVideoCall()</code> to shut down and reset the connection and release resources. It then builds a <code>\"hang-up\"</code> message and sends it to the other end of the call to tell the other peer to neatly shut itself down.</p>\n<h5 id=\"ending_the_call_2\">Ending the

connection exists; if it does, we proceed to disconnect and close the call:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>All of the event handlers are removed. This prevents stray event handlers from being triggered while the connection is in the process of closing, potentially causing errors.</li>\n  <li>For both remote and local video streams, we iterate over each track, calling the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack/stop\"><code>MediaStreamTrack.stop()</code></a> method to close each one.</li>\n  <li>Close the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection\"><code>RTCPeerConnection</code></a> by calling <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/close\" title=\"myPeerConnection.close()\"><code>myPeerConnection.close()</code></a>.</li>\n  <li>Set <code>myPeerConnection</code> to <code>null</code>, ensuring our code learns there's no ongoing call; this is useful when the user clicks a name in the user list.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Then for both the incoming and outgoing <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video\"><code>&lt;video&gt;</code></a> elements, we remove their <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video#attr-src\"><code>src</code></a> and <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video#attr-srcobject\"><code>srcobject</code></a> attributes using their <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/removeAttribute\" title=\"removeAttribute()\"><code>removeAttribute()</code></a> methods. This completes the disassociation of the streams from the video elements.</p>\n<p>Finally, we set the <a class=\"page-not-created\" title=\"The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!\"><code>disabled</code></a> property to <code>true</code> on the \"Hang Up\" button, making it unclickable while there is no call underway; then we set <code>targetUsername</code> to <code>null</code> since we're no longer talking to anyone.
