This will only be evicted if the user chooses to (for example, in Firefox you can choose to delete all stored data or only stored data from selected origins by going to <em>Preferences</em> and using the options under <em>Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Cookies &amp; Site Data</em>).</li>\n  <li>Temporary: This is data that doesn't need to persist for a very long time. This will be evicted under a least-recently-used (<a href=\"#lru_policy\">LRU policy</a>) when <a href=\"#storage_limits\">Storage limits</a> are reached.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In Firefox, when persistent storage is used, the user is given a UI popup to alert them that this data will persist, and asks if they are happy with that.

The <strong>global limit</strong> is calculated as 50% of free disk space. In Firefox, an internal browser tool called the Quota Manager keeps track of how much disk space each origin is using up, and deletes data if necessary.</p>\n<p>So if the free space on your hard drive is 500 GB, then the total storage for a browser is 250 GB. If this is exceeded, a process called <strong>origin eviction</strong> comes into play, deleting an entire origin's worth of data until the storage amount goes under the limit again. There is no trimming effect put in place to delete parts of origins — deleting one database of an origin could cause problems with inconsistency.</p>\n<p>There's also another limit called <strong>group limit</strong> — this is defined as 20% of the global limit, but it has a minimum of 10 MB and a maximum of 2 GB. Each origin is part of a group (group of origins). There's one group for each eTLD+1 domain. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><code>mozilla.org</code> — group1, origin1</li>\n  <li><code>www.mozilla.org</code> — group1, origin2</li>\n  <li><code>joe.blogs.mozilla.org</code> — group1, origin3</li>\n  <li><code>firefox.com</code> — group2, origin4</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this group, <code>mozilla.org</code>, <code>www.mozilla.org</code>, and <code>joe.blogs.mozilla.org</code> can aggregately use a maximum of 20% of the global limit. <code>firefox.com</code> has a separate maximum of 20%.</p>\n<p>The two limits react differently to limits being reached:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The group limit is also called the \"hard limit\": it doesn't trigger origin eviction.</li>\n  <li>The global limit is a \"soft limit\" since there's a chance that some space will be freed and the operation can continue.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"notecard note\" id=\"sect7\">\n  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The group limit can't be more than the global limit, despite the minimum group limit mentioned above.
