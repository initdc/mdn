Every push notification should be useful and time-sensitive, and the user should always be asked for permission before sending the first one, and be offered an easy way to opt out of getting more in the future.</p>\n<p>There are some basic questions you can answer to determine if a push notification is needed:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Is there someone waiting in real-time for a response? In our above example, the program manager is awaiting your response and so a push notification is appropriate.</li>\n  <li>Is up-to-the minute updating necessary? I use a service that aggregates different social media news sources. When a story I'm interested in is trending, I'd like to get a notification!</li>\n  <li>Is there breaking news that is timely? This is where it gets a little tricky. Sometimes news sites request push notifications so they can essentially say \"Look at me! Look at me!\" It all comes down to what the user wants, and you can use behavior to determine intent. For example, if the user views more than one article, or lingers on your page for several minutes, they may be interested in receiving updates.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to the question of whether a push notification is required at all, there are many different types of push notifications, ranging from casual-and-disappearing to persistent-and-requiring-interaction.</p>\n<p>We caution you to use the interaction-requiring ones very sparingly, since they can be the most annoying. Your notifications should be assistive, not disruptive.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"building_trust","title":"Building trust","isH3":false,"content":"<p>Some studies have shown that as many as 60% of push notifications are blocked.
