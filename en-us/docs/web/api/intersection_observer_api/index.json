As the web has matured, the need for this kind of information has grown. Intersection information is needed for many reasons, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Lazy-loading of images or other content as a page is scrolled.</li>\n  <li>Implementing \"infinite scrolling\" web sites, where more and more content is loaded and rendered as you scroll, so that the user doesn't have to flip through pages.</li>\n  <li>Reporting of visibility of advertisements in order to calculate ad revenues.</li>\n  <li>Deciding whether or not to perform tasks or animation processes based on whether or not the user will see the result.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Implementing intersection detection in the past involved event handlers and loops calling methods like <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect\"><code>Element.getBoundingClientRect()</code></a> to build up the needed information for every element affected. Since all this code runs on the main thread, even one of these can cause performance problems. When a site is loaded with these tests, things can get downright ugly.</p>\n<p>Consider a web page that uses infinite scrolling. It uses a vendor-provided library to manage the advertisements placed periodically throughout the page, has animated graphics here and there, and uses a custom library that draws notification boxes and the like. Each of these has its own intersection detection routines, all running on the main thread. The author of the web site may not even realize this is happening, since they may know very little about the inner workings of the two libraries they are using. As the user scrolls the page, these intersection detection routines are firing constantly during the scroll handling code, resulting in an experience that leaves the user frustrated with the browser, the web site, and their computer.</p>\n<p>The Intersection Observer API lets code register a callback function that is executed whenever an element they wish to monitor enters or exits another element (or the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/Viewport\">viewport</a>), or when the amount by which the two intersect changes by a requested amount. This way, sites no longer need to do anything on the main thread to watch for this kind of element intersection, and the browser is free to optimize the management of intersections as it sees fit.</p>\n<p>One thing the Intersection Observer API can't tell you: the exact number of pixels that overlap or specifically which ones they are; however, it covers the much more common use case of \"If they intersect by somewhere around <em>N</em>%, I need to do something.\"</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"intersection_observer_concepts_and_usage","title":"Intersection observer concepts and usage","isH3":false,"content":"<p>The Intersection Observer API allows you to configure a callback that is called when either of these circumstances occur:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>A <strong>target</strong> element intersects either the device's viewport or a specified element. That specified element is called the <strong>root element</strong> or <strong>root</strong> for the purposes of the Intersection Observer API.</li>\n  <li>The first time the observer is initially asked to watch a target element.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Typically, you'll want to watch for intersection changes with regard to the target element's closest scrollable ancestor, or, if the target element isn't a descendant of a scrollable element, the device's viewport. To watch for intersection relative to the device's viewport, specify <code>null</code> for <code>root</code> option. Keep reading for a more detailed explanation about intersection observer options.</p>\n<p>Whether you're using the viewport or some other element as the root, the API works the same way, executing a callback function you provide whenever the visibility of the target element changes so that it crosses desired amounts of intersection with the root.</p>\n<p>The degree of intersection between the target element and its root is the <strong>intersection ratio</strong>.

If you want the callback to run every time visibility passes another 25%, you would specify the array [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1].

It should operate as quickly as possible; if anything time-consuming needs to be done, use <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestIdleCallback\"><code>Window.requestIdleCallback()</code></a>.</p>\n<p>Also, note that if you specified the <code>root</code> option, the target must be a descendant of the root element.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"how_intersection_is_calculated","title":"How intersection is calculated","isH3":true,"content":"<p>All areas considered by the Intersection Observer API are rectangles; elements which are irregularly shaped are considered as occupying the smallest rectangle which encloses all of the element's parts. Similarly, if the visible portion of an element is not rectangular, the element's intersection rectangle is considered to be the smallest rectangle that contains all the visible portions of the element.</p>\n<p>It's useful to understand a bit about how the various properties provided by <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserverEntry\"><code>IntersectionObserverEntry</code></a> describe an intersection.</p>\n<h4 id=\"the_intersection_root_and_root_margin\">The intersection root and root margin</h4>\n<p>Before we can track the intersection of an element with a container, we need to know what that container is. That container is the <strong>intersection root</strong>, or <strong>root element</strong>. This can be either a specific element in the document which is an ancestor of the element to be observed, or <code>null</code> to use the document's viewport as the container.</p>\n<p>The <strong><em>root intersection rectangle</em></strong> is the rectangle used to check against the target or targets. This rectangle is determined like this:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>If the intersection root is the implicit root (that is, the top-level <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document\"><code>Document</code></a>), the root intersection rectangle is the viewport's rectangle.</li>\n  <li>If the intersection root has an overflow clip, the root intersection rectangle is the root element's content area.</li>\n  <li>Otherwise, the root intersection rectangle is the intersection root's bounding client rectangle (as returned by calling <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect\" title=\"getBoundingClientRect()\"><code>getBoundingClientRect()</code></a> on it).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The root intersection rectangle can be adjusted further by setting the <strong>root margin</strong>, <code>rootMargin</code>, when creating the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver\"><code>IntersectionObserver</code></a>. The values in <code>rootMargin</code> define offsets added to each side of the intersection root's bounding box to create the final intersection root bounds (which are disclosed in <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserverEntry/rootBounds\"><code>IntersectionObserverEntry.rootBounds</code></a> when the callback is executed).</p>\n<h4 id=\"thresholds\">Thresholds</h4>\n<p>Rather than reporting every infinitesimal change in how much a target element is visible, the Intersection Observer API uses <strong>thresholds</strong>. When you create an observer, you can provide one or more numeric values representing percentages of the target element which are visible. Then, the API only reports changes to visibility which cross these thresholds.</p>\n<p>For example, if you want to be informed every time a target's visibility passes backward or forward through each 25% mark, you would specify the array [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1] as the list of thresholds when creating the observer.</p>\n<p>When the callback is invoked, it receives a list of <code>IntersectionObserverEntry</code> objects, one for each observed target which has had the degree to which it intersects the root change such that the amount exposed crosses over one of the thresholds, in either direction.</p>\n<p>You can see if the target <em>currently</em> intersects the root by looking at the entry's <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserverEntry/isIntersecting\" title=\"isIntersecting\"><code>isIntersecting</code></a> property; if its value is <code>true</code>, the target is at least partially intersecting the root element or document. This lets you determine whether the entry represents a transition from the elements intersecting to no longer intersecting or a transition from not intersecting to intersecting.</p>\n<p>Note that it's possible to have a non-zero intersection rectangle, which can happen if the intersection is exactly along the boundary between the two or the area of <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserverEntry/boundingClientRect\" title=\"boundingClientRect\"><code>boundingClientRect</code></a> is zero. This state of the target and root sharing a boundary line is not considered enough to be considered transitioning into an intersecting state.</p>\n<p>To get a feeling for how thresholds work, try scrolling the box below around. Each colored box within it displays the percentage of itself that's visible in all four of its corners, so you can see these ratios change over time as you scroll the container. Each box has a different set of thresholds:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The first box has a threshold for each percentage point of visibility; that is, the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/thresholds\"><code>IntersectionObserver.thresholds</code></a> array is <code>[0.00, 0.01, 0.02, /*…,*/ 0.99, 1.00]</code>.</li>\n  <li>The second box has a single threshold, at the 50% mark.</li>\n  <li>The third box has thresholds every 10% of visibility (0%, 10%, 20%, etc.).</li>\n  <li>The last box has thresholds each 25%.</li>\n</ul>\n<div

id=\"clipping_and_the_intersection_rectangle\">Clipping and the intersection rectangle</h4>\n<p>The browser computes the final intersection rectangle as follows; this is all done for you, but it can be helpful to understand these steps in order to better grasp exactly when intersections will occur.</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>The target element's bounding rectangle (that is, the smallest rectangle that fully encloses the bounding boxes of every component that makes up the element) is obtained by calling <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect\" title=\"getBoundingClientRect()\"><code>getBoundingClientRect()</code></a> on the target. This is the largest the intersection rectangle may be. The remaining steps will remove any portions that don't intersect.</li>\n  <li>Starting at the target's immediate parent block and moving outward, each containing block's clipping (if any) is applied to the intersection rectangle. A block's clipping is determined based on the intersection of the two blocks and the clipping mode (if any) specified by the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow\"><code>overflow</code></a> property. Setting <code>overflow</code> to anything but <code>visible</code> causes clipping to occur.</li>\n  <li>If one of the containing elements is the root of a nested browsing context (such as the document contained in an <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe\"><code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code></a>), the intersection rectangle is clipped to the containing context's viewport, and recursion upward through the containers continues with the container's containing block. So if the top level of an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> is reached, the intersection rectangle is clipped to the frame's viewport, then the frame's parent element is the next block recursed through toward the intersection root.</li>\n  <li>When recursion upward reaches the intersection root, the resulting rectangle is mapped to the intersection root's coordinate space.</li>\n  <li>The resulting rectangle is then updated by intersecting it with the <a href=\"#root-intersection-rectangle\">root intersection rectangle</a>.</li>\n  <li>This rectangle is, finally, mapped to the coordinate space of the target's <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document\"><code>document</code></a>.</li>\n</ol>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"intersection_change_callbacks","title":"Intersection change callbacks","isH3":true,"content":"<p>When the amount of a target element which is visible within the root element crosses one of the visibility thresholds, the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver\"><code>IntersectionObserver</code></a> object's callback is executed.

We want to watch for changes in visibility of the target element relative to the document's viewport, so <code>root</code> is <code>null</code>. We need no margin, so the margin offset, <code>rootMargin</code>, is specified as \"0px\". This causes the observer to watch for changes in the intersection between the target element's bounds and those of the viewport, without any added (or subtracted) space.</p>\n<p>The list of visibility ratio thresholds, <code>threshold</code>, is constructed by the function <code>buildThresholdList()</code>. The threshold list is built programmatically in this example since there are a number of them and the number is intended to be adjustable.</p>\n<p>Once <code>options</code> is ready, we create the new observer, calling the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/IntersectionObserver\" title=\"IntersectionObserver()\"><code>IntersectionObserver()</code></a> constructor, specifying a function to be called when intersection crosses one of our thresholds, <code>handleIntersect()</code>, and our set of options. We then call <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/observe\" title=\"observe()\"><code>observe()</code></a> on the returned observer, passing into it the desired target element.</p>\n<p>We could opt to monitor multiple elements for visibility intersection changes with respect to the viewport by calling <code>observer.observe()</code> for each of those elements, if we wanted to do so.</p>\n<h4 id=\"building_the_array_of_threshold_ratios\">Building the array of threshold ratios</h4>\n<p>The <code>buildThresholdList()</code> function, which builds the list of thresholds, looks like this:</p>\n<div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: js notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">buildThresholdList</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> thresholds <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> numSteps <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">20</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">for</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> i<span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token number\">1.0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> i<span class=\"token operator\">&lt;=</span>numSteps<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> i<span class=\"token operator\">++</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> ratio <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> i<span class=\"token operator\">/</span>numSteps<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    thresholds<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">push</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>ratio<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n  thresholds<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">push</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> thresholds<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This builds the array of thresholds—each of which is a ratio between 0.0 and 1.0, by pushing the value <code>i/numSteps</code> onto the <code>thresholds</code> array for each integer <code>i</code> between 1 and <code>numSteps</code>.
