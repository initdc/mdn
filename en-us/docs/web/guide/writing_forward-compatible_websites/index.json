For example, if you have this markup:</p>\n<div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: html notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>div</span> <span class=\"token special-attr\"><span class=\"token attr-name\">onclick</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span><span class=\"token value javascript language-javascript\"><span class=\"token function\">alert</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>ownerDocument<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">&gt;</span></span>Click me<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">&gt;</span></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>then clicking on the text alerts the <code>ownerDocument</code> of the <code>div</code>. This happens even if there is an <code>ownerDocument</code> variable declared in the global scope.</p>\n<p>What this means is that any time you access a global variable in an event handler content attribute, including calling any function declared globally, you can end up with a name collision if a specification adds a new DOM property to elements or documents which has the same name as your function or variable, and a browser implements it. If that happens, then suddenly your function stops being called. This has happened multiple times to various sites already during the evolution of HTML.</p>\n<p>To avoid this, fully qualify global variable access using \"window.\", like so:</p>\n<div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: html notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>script</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">&gt;</span></span><span class=\"token script\"><span class=\"token language-javascript\">\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">localName</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token function\">alert</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"Function localName has been called\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n</span></span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>script</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">&gt;</span></span>\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>div</span> <span class=\"token special-attr\"><span class=\"token attr-name\">onclick</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span><span class=\"token value javascript language-javascript\">window<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">localName</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">&gt;</span></span>\n  Clicking me should show an alert\n  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>div</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">&gt;</span></span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">&gt;</span></span>\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">&gt;</span></span>\n</code></pre></div>","titleAsText":"Prefix all global variable access in onfoo attributes with \"window.\""}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"dont_concatenate_scripts_you_dont_control","title":"Don't concatenate scripts you don't control","isH3":true,"content":"<p>The <code>\"use strict\";</code> directive in ECMAScript, when used on the file level, applies to everything in the file.

Don't assume that browsers with support for a given DOM feature must also have some other, especially nonstandard, DOM feature. Or, conversely, that they <em>don't</em> have support for some other feature (e.g., don't assume that a browser that supports <code>onload</code> on script elements will never support <code>onreadystatechange</code> on them).
