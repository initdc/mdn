This little library will \"normalize\" the interfaces for you and make it look as if your code is running in a standards compliant browser, by aliasing prefixed names to the unprefixed versions. And it won't do anything if the unprefixed versions are already present.</p>\n<p>Once you include it in your page, you can write in \"modern Web Audio API\" style, and do things such as:</p>\n<div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: js notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> audioContext <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">AudioContext</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>everywhere, including Chrome/ium, Opera, Safari, and ---of course!--- Firefox.</p>\n<p>Also, if new methods such as <code>start</code> are not detected in some nodes, the library will also alias them to their old names. Thus, <code>start</code> is mapped to <code>noteOn</code>, <code>stop</code> to <code>noteOff</code>, and so on.</p>\n<p>If you're porting moderately \"old\" code (say, a year old) it's possible that it uses some methods that <code>AudioContext-MonkeyPatch</code> doesn't alias, because it helps you to write code in the <em>new</em> style. For example, the way to create instances of <code>GainNode</code> used to be</p>\n<div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: js notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> gain <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> audioContext<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">createGainNode</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>but nowadays it is just</p>\n<div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: js notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> gain <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> audioContext<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">createGain</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Since the old method names are not present in Firefox, existing code may crash with something like <code>createGainNode is not a function</code>, and you now know why.</p>\n<p>There's <a href=\"https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html#OldNames\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">a section</a> in the spec that lists the old names and their updated equivalences; be sure to check it out and change your code accordingly. You can also check <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Migrating_from_webkitAudioContext\">this article</a> on porting which covers more cases and has many code samples.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"things_that_are_not_ready_yet","title":"Things that are not ready yet","isH3":false,"content":"<p>Second, ensure that your project doesn't use node types that are not implemented yet in Firefox: <a href=\"https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html#MediaStreamAudioSourceNode\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">MediaStreamAudioSourceNode</a>, <a href=\"https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html#MediaElementAudioSourceNode\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">MediaElementAudioSourceNode</a> and <a href=\"https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html#OscillatorNode\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">OscillatorNode</a>.</p>\n<p>If it's using, for example, <code>OscillatorNode</code>, you will have to wait until it is supported, or maybe, if you're really eager, hack in some replacement using <a href=\"https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html#ScriptProcessorNode-section\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">ScriptProcessorNode</a>, which allows you to write a node with callbacks that get called periodically, so that your JavaScript code generates or processes audio.</p>\n<p>The node parameters you use must also be supported in Firefox too.

If you're a person that learns by example, it might be interesting to have a look at their source and see how they have resolved the compatibility issues.</p>"}}],"toc":[{"text":"Writing for today (and tomorrow)","id":"writing_for_today_and_tomorrow"},{"text":"Things that are not ready yet","id":"things_that_are_not_ready_yet"}],"summary":"You probably have already read the announcement on the Web Audio API coming to Firefox, and are totally excited and ready to make your until-now-WebKit-only sites work with Firefox, which uses the unprefixed version of the spec.","popularity":0.0002,"modified":"2022-09-09T07:06:10.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/guide/audio_and_video_delivery/web_audio_api_cross_browser","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/style/old/files/en-us/web/guide/audio_and_video_delivery/web_audio_api_cross_browser/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/f4f8e2f18ccf19a0bee59e1fe78753e276b98232","filename":"index.md"},"parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"Web technology for developers"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Guide","title":"Developer guides"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Audio_and_video_delivery","title":"Audio and Video Delivery"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Audio_and_video_delivery/Web_Audio_API_cross_browser","title":"Writing Web Audio API code that works in every browser"}],"pageTitle":"Writing Web Audio API code that works in every browser - Developer guides | MDN","noIndexing":false}}
