This information is retrieved differently on each platform, because some platforms use asynchronous events.</p>\n<p>In IAccessible2, this is retrieved from the object attribute \"event-from-input\", which will be set to \"true\" or \"false\". If it is not present, then something went wrong and Mozilla was not able to provide this information. This information is available only for EVENT_SHOW, EVENT_HIDE, IA2_EVENT_TEXT_INSERTED and IA2_EVENT_TEXT_REMOVED.</p>\n<p>For ATK/AT-SPI, this information is retrieved by checking the event name. If the event name has \":system\" appended to it, then it is /not/ from user input. The \":system\" string is calculated for children-changed and text-changed events.</p>\n<p>Why is this useful? The majority of AJAX pages do not provide live region markup, but still need to be as usable as possible. It is difficult for a screen reader to decide when to interrupt a user with changes on a page. If the screen reader automatically reads too much, then the web page will be too annoying to use. If the screen reader doesn't read anything, then the user may miss important information.</p>\n<p>It is believed this information will be useful for heuristics. Often, changes in a page that are directly caused by a user's keystrokes should be read. They are synchronous with what the user is doing and can thus likely be read without disorienting the user. Once the user presses the next key the speech will move on to echoing that key anyway. The screen reader may wish to take other factors into account, such as the type of change, the size of the change, where the change occurred, etc. This is a potential area for innovation in screen readers.</p>\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Most recent occurrence</th>\n      <th>User input?</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Key presses</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Mouse clicks</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Mouse hovers</td>\n      <td>No</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Page load events</td>\n      <td>No</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Everything else, including focus changes, timer callbacks, XMLHttpRequest callbacks, etc. are neutral.
