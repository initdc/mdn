Some of these are a matter of the form of the source audio; others are related to decisions made while encoding the audio.</p>\n<h4 id=\"lossless_versus_lossy_codecs\">Lossless versus lossy codecs</h4>\n<p>There are two basic categories of audio compression. <strong>Lossless</strong> compression algorithms reduce the size of the audio without compromising the quality or fidelity of the sound. Upon decoding audio compressed with a lossless codec such as <a href=\"#flac_free_lossless_audio_codec\">FLAC</a> or <a href=\"#alac_apple_lossless_audio_codec\">ALAC</a>, the result is identical in every way to the original sound, down to the bit.</p>\n<p><strong>Lossy</strong> codecs, on the other hand, take advantage of the fact that the human ear is not a perfect interpreter of audio, and of the fact that the human brain can pluck the important information out of imperfect or noisy audio. They strip away audio frequencies that aren't used much, tolerate loss of precision in the decoded output, and use other methods to lose audio content, quality, and fidelity to produce smaller encoded media. Upon decoding, the output is, to varying degrees, still understandable. The specific codec used—and the compression configuration selected—determine how close to the original, uncompressed audio signal the output seems to be when heard by the human ear.</p>\n<p>Because of the differences in how lossy codecs work compared to lossless ones, especially the fact that lossless ones have to be much more conservative with their compression, lossy codecs nearly always result in significantly smaller compressed audio than lossless codecs do.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, the most common reasons to choose lossless audio are because you require archival-quality storage, or because the audio samples will be remixed and recompressed, and you wish to avoid the amplification of artifacts in the audio due to recompression. For real-time streaming of audio, a lossy codec is usually required in order to ensure the flow of data can keep up with the audio playback rate regardless of network performance.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"maximum_number_of_channels","title":"Maximum number of channels","isH3":true,"content":"<p>The audio delivered to each speaker in a sound system is provided by one audio channel in a stream. Monaural sound is a single channel. Stereo sound is two. 5.1 surround sound has five audio channels, plus one <strong>Low Frequency Enhancement</strong> (<strong>LFE</strong>) channel.</p>\n<p>LFE channels are specifically designed to store low-frequency audio data, and are commonly used to provide audio data for subwoofers, for example. When you see the number of audio channels written in the form X.Y (such as 2.1 or 5.1), the number after the decimal point, Y, is the number of LFE channels. For example, MP3 supports one LFE channel, while AAC supports up to 16.</p>\n<p>In addition to providing audio for specific speakers in a sound system, some codecs may allow audio channels to be used to provide alternative audio, such as vocals in different languages or descriptive audio for visually impaired people.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"audio_frequency_bandwidth","title":"Audio frequency bandwidth","isH3":true,"content":"<p>The <strong>audio frequency bandwidth</strong> of a codec indicates the range of audio frequencies that can be represented using the codec. Some codecs operate specifically by eliminating audio that falls outside a given frequency range. There is a correlation between the sample rate and the maximum sound frequency that can be represented by a waveform represented by a codec. At a theoretical level, the maximum frequency a codec can represent is the sample rate divided by two; this frequency is called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_frequency\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Nyquist frequency</a>. In reality, the maximum is slightly lower, but it's close.</p>\n<p>The audio frequency bandwidth comes into play especially vividly when a codec is designed or configured to represent human speech rather than a broad range of sounds. Human speech generally resides within the audio frequency range of 300 Hz to 18 kHz. However, the vast majority of human vocalizations exist in the range 300 Hz to 8 kHz, and you can capture enough of human vocalizations in the frequency range 500 Hz to 3 kHz to still be understandable.</p>\n<p>For that reason, speech-specific codecs often begin by dropping sound that falls outside a set range. That range is the audio frequency bandwidth. G.722, for example, strips away sounds outside the audio frequency bandwidth of 50 Hz to 7 kHz. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be encoded from the outset.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"codec_details","title":"Codec details","isH3":false,"content":"<p>Below we take a brief look at each of these codecs, looking at their basic capabilities and their primary use cases.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"aac_advanced_audio_coding","title":"AAC (Advanced Audio Coding)","isH3":true,"content":"<p>The <strong>Advanced Audio Coding</strong> (<strong>AAC</strong>) codec is defined as part of the MPEG-4 (H.264) standard; specifically, as part of <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/standard/53943.html\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">MPEG-4 Part 3</a> and <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/standard/43345.html\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">MPEG-2 Part 7</a>.

Here we'll provide guidance to help you select an appropriate codec for your use case.</p>\n<p>When choosing a codec to use for your audio, you should first consider the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Will the encoded audio be getting remixed or recompressed? If so, avoid lossy compression, which would be compounded by recompressing the audio; or at least use as little compression as possible.</li>\n  <li>If the audio needs to go into a specific file type, keep that in mind, since media containers typically support a specific subset of the available codecs.</li>\n  <li>What kind of audio content will the codec be handling?
