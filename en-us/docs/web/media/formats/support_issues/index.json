In the case of an action movie, for example, the poster frame might be an iconic exemplar image from one of the film's best-known scenes.</p>\n<p>A similar concept can be applied to still images; if an image you wish to present is very large and may take time to download (especially for slower devices or connections), you can offer a lower-resolution or alternate version that will be displayed until the full-quality version is available to be displayed.</p>\n<p>We'll look at both of these scenarios and how to implement them.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"poster_frames_for_video","title":"Poster frames for video","isH3":true,"content":""}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"progressive_images","title":"Progressive images","isH3":true,"content":"<p>Images—whether embedded using <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img\"><code>&lt;img&gt;</code></a> or <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture\"><code>&lt;picture&gt;</code></a>—don't support a concept similar to poster frames.
