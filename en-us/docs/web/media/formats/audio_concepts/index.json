As an object vibrates, it causes the molecules surrounding it to vibrate as well. These molecules affect the ones adjacent to them, and so forth, propagating the vibration in the form of a wave outward from the source until the amplitude of the wave (its volume) fades away with distance. The granularity of an audio wave in the real world, then, is that of an individual molecule of the medium through which the sound wave is traveling.</p>\n<p>On Earth, the medium most audio travels through is the air. Some audio does travel through water, or even through the rock comprising the planet itself (if you've ever heard the rumble or boom of an earthquake, you've experienced this phenomenon), but nearly all of the sounds you hear every day travel to your ears through the air.</p>\n<p>The sounds a person hears every day are, then, actually vibrations in the air which cause the inner workings of the ear. The farther the air molecules move with each pulse of the wave, the higher the amplitude of the wave, and the louder the sound is.

The audio bandwidth is also affected by the codec, if it chooses to discard any frequency bands while encoding the sound.</p>\n<p>Sound enters the computer through a microphone or other input in the form of a stream of electrons whose voltage varies to represent the amplitude of the sound wave. This analog signal is then converted into digital form by a circuit that captures the incoming wave's amplitude at regular intervals, converting that data into a number in a form that is understood by the audio recording system. Each of these captured moments is a <strong>sample</strong>. By chaining all the samples together, you can approximately represent the original wave, as seen in the diagram below.</p>\n<p>\n  <img src=\"/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Audio_concepts/audio-waveform-samples1.svg\" alt=\"An audio waveform with samples taken periodically\" width=\"691\" height=\"287\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</p>\n<p>In this example, the blue line represents the samples taken from the audio waveform, which is black. At regular intervals, the A/D converter circuitry reads the voltage of the signal as a value between (in this case) -1.0 and +1.0. Since the amplitude varies over the duration of that time slice, the A/D converter must choose a value to represent that slice, whether by taking the value at a particular moment (in the diagram above, the midpoint of each slice is used as the value), or by averaging the amplitude over the duration of each sample. Those sample values are then recorded as the amplitude of the waveform at that time.</p>\n<p>When it comes time to play back that sound later, these amplitudes are used to generate an approximation of the original waveform; instead of playing back an exact duplicate of the original, smooth wave, the rougher, blue wave is played.</p>\n<p>The more often you take samples of the original audio, the closer to the original you can get. The number of samples taken per second is called the <strong>sample rate</strong>.

There are several formats used for the individual samples within an audio file. Most audio files use 16-bit signed integers for each sample, but others use 32-bit floating-point values or 24-bit or 32-bit integers. Some older audio file formats—which you won't find in use on the web—used 8-bit integer samples. In addition, samples may use signed or unsigned values, as well. The size of an individual sample is called the <strong>sample size</strong>.</p>\n<p>The position of each audio source within the audio signal is called a <strong>channel</strong>. Each channel contains a sample indicating the amplitude of the audio being produced by that source at a given moment in time. For instance, in stereo sound, there are two audio sources: one speaker on the left, and one on the right. Each of these is represented by one channel, and the number of channels contained in the audio signal is called the <strong>channel count</strong>.</p>\n<p>While recording or generating multi-channel audio files, the channels are assembled into a series of <strong>audio frames</strong>, each consisting of one sample for each of the audio's channels. An individual sample is a numeric value representing the amplitude of the sound <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waveform\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">waveform</a> at a single moment in time, and may be represented in various formats.</p>\n<p>Stereo audio is probably the most commonly used channel arrangement in web audio, and 16-bit samples are used for the majority of day-to-day audio in use today. For 16-bit stereo audio, each sample taken from the analog signal is recorded as two 16-bit integers, one for the left channel and one for the right. That means each sample requires 32 bits of memory. At the common sample rate of 48 kHz (48,000 samples per second), this means each second of audio occupies 192 kB of memory. Therefore, a typical three-minute song requires about 34.5 MB of memory. That's a lot of storage, but worse, it's an insane amount of network bandwidth to use for a relatively short piece of audio. That's why most digital audio is compressed.</p>\n<p>The process of compressing and decompressing audio is performed by encoding and decoding it using an audio <strong><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/Codec\">codec</a></strong> (<strong>CO</strong>der/<strong>DE</strong>coder). Over the years, a large variety of codecs have been developed, several of which are commonly used on the web.

Standard audio channels are used to present the majority of the audible sound. The sound for the left and right main channels, as well as all of your surround sound speakers (center, left and right rear, left and right sides, ceiling channels, and so forth) are all standard audio channels. Special <strong>Low Frequency Enhancement</strong> (<strong>LFE</strong>) channels provide the signal for special speakers designed to produce the low frequency sounds and vibration to create a visceral sensation when listening to the audio. The LFE channels typically drive subwoofers and similar devices.</p>\n<p>Monophonic audio has one channel, stereo sound has two channels, 5.1 surround sound has 6 channels (five standard and one LFE), and so forth. Each audio frame is a data record that contains the samples for all of the channels available in an audio signal. The size of an audio frame is calculated by multiplying the sample size in bytes by the number of channels, so a single frame of stereo 16-bit audio is 4 bytes long and a single frame of 5.1 floating-point audio is 24 (4 bytes per sample multiplied by 6 channels).</p>\n<div class=\"notecard note\" id=\"sect1\">\n  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Some codecs will actually separate the left and right channels, storing them in separate blocks within their data structure. However, an audio frame is always comprised of all of the data for all available channels.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The number of frames that comprise a single second of audio varies depending on the sample rate used when recording the sound. Since the sample rate corresponds to the number of \"slices\" a sound wave is divided into for each second of time, it's sometimes thought of as a frequency (in the sense that it's a description of something that repeats periodically, not in terms of actual audio frequency), and the samples per second measurement therefore uses the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Hertz</a> as its unit.</p>\n<p>The most common sample rates are:</p>\n<dl>\n  <dt id=\"8000_hz\">8000 Hz</dt>\n  <dd>\n    <p>The international <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.711\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">G.711</a> standard for audio used in telephony uses a sample rate of 8000 Hz (8 kHz).

Doubling that per the Nyquist theorem results in a final minimum frequency of (you guessed it) 44.1 kHz.</p>\n<p>High-resolution (96 kHz) audio is used in some high-end audio systems, and it and ultra-high resolution (192 kHz) audio are useful for audio mastering, where you need as much quality as possible while manipulating and editing the sound before downsampling to the sample rate you will use for the final product.

In addition, the vast majority of human speech sounds tend to lie between 500 Hz and 3,000 Hz or so, making it possible to drop substantial portions of the overall waveform without compromising the listener's ability to understand the words being said. You can even adjust the audio bandwidth to factor in the pitch of the individual speaker's voice.</p>\n<p>Because of all these factors, and because speech waveforms are typically less complex than music, high (and more specifically \"high enough\") fidelity reproduction of speech can be achieved at a relatively low bit rate.</p>\n<p>When a compression algorithm designed to compress general audio analyzes an audio waveform, it can discard anything outside the range of human hearing (or possibly even more, depending on how willing the algorithm is willing to risk losing detail at the high and/or low end of the frequency band). That means that the codec can discard audio whose frequency is lower than about 20 Hz or higher than about 20,000 Hz (20 kHz).

More often, people's ability to hear higher frequencies is rather lower than this; in particular, it's worth noting that by middle age, the high end of that frequency range usually falls from 20 kHz down to around 12 kHz to 14 kHz. This suggests that the higher frequencies can often be discarded without overly affecting comprehensibility of the sound, so you can substantially reduce how much of the audio space you need to retain, thereby making your sound simpler and easier to compress.</p>\n<p>This is portrayed in the diagram below.

This indicates a quality level to maintain for the duration of the audio, allowing the bit rate to fluctuate as needed to achieve that quality level. In portions of the sound where compression is easily achieved with minimum impact to quality, the bit rate may be very low, while in areas where compression is more complex, the bit rate will be higher.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"audio_frequency_bandwidth","title":"Audio frequency bandwidth","isH3":true,"content":"<p>Some codecs allow you to configure the audio frequency bandwidth directly, either by specifying the range of frequencies to allow, by establishing upper and/or lower frequency limits, or by specifying an audio source type that determines how to configure the algorithm based on the expected frequency use of the incoming signal.</p>\n<p>In addition, some codecs support special limited frequency bandwidth channels, such as the LFE channel, which inherently limit the frequency range available.

This results in audio frames which require 2⨉_sampleSize_ bits each, where <em>sampleSize</em> is the number of bits each audio sample takes. Therefore, for a 16-bit stereo audio recording, each sample uses 2⨉16 or 32 bits of space. This is standard left/right (L/R) stereo or <strong>simple stereo</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Joint stereo</strong> is a method of storing stereo audio samples in a more space-efficient manner by taking into account that usually the sound entering each ear is similar. Thus, rather than storing every bit of each channel's sample, a base amplitude and a per-channel amplitude deviation value are stored, wherein the deviation value may use fewer bits than a complete sample.</p>\n<p>There are two types of joint stereo: mid-side and intensity. Over the duration of an audio file, the encoder may change which format is being used to represent the stereo signal over the course of the audio file.</p>\n<h4 id=\"mid-side_stereo_coding\">Mid-side stereo coding</h4>\n<p><strong>Mid-side stereo coding</strong> (<strong>MS</strong>) works by recording frames that contain a fundamental <strong>mid channel</strong>, which is the average amplitude of the original left and right audio channels. This is essentially what you would calculate as the amplitude when converting a stereo signal into mono. Then you store the <strong>side channel</strong> value; this value is a number which can be added to the <strong>mid channel</strong> value to determine left channel's original amplitude, and subtracted from the mid channel value to compute the right channel's original value.</p>\n<p>In other words, given a left channel, L, and a right channel, R, you perform the following calculations when encoding a sample:</p>\n<p>\n  <math display=\"block\">\n    <semantics>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"italic\">mid</mi>\n        <mo>=</mo>\n        <mfrac>\n          <mrow>\n            <mi>L</mi>\n            <mo>+</mo>\n            <mi>R</mi>\n          </mrow>\n          <mn>2</mn>\n        </mfrac>\n      </mrow>\n      <annotation encoding=\"TeX\">mid = \\frac { L + R }{ 2 }</annotation>\n    </semantics>\n  </math>\n</p>\n<p>\n  <math display=\"block\">\n    <semantics>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"italic\">side</mi>\n        <mo>=</mo>\n        <mfrac>\n          <mrow>\n            <mi>L</mi>\n            <mo>-</mo>\n            <mi>R</mi>\n          </mrow>\n          <mn>2</mn>\n        </mfrac>\n      </mrow>\n      <annotation encoding=\"TeX\">side = \\frac { L - R }{ 2 }</annotation>\n    </semantics>\n  </math>\n</p>\n<p>Then you store the values of <code>mid</code> and <code>side</code>. While <code>mid</code> is still the same size as your sample size (such as 16 bits), the value of <code>side</code> can probably be stored in a smaller number of bits, since the amplitude of the two channels is probably relatively similar. The encoder can then take this smaller number of total bits per frame and perform additional computations to further reduce the size.</p>\n<p>While decoding the audio, the absolute left and right channel values are calculated like this:</p>\n<p>\n  <math display=\"block\">\n    <semantics>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>L</mi>\n        <mo>=</mo>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"italic\">mid</mi>\n        <mo>+</mo>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"italic\">side</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <annotation encoding=\"TeX\">L\\quad =\\quad mid\\quad +\\quad side</annotation>\n    </semantics>\n  </math>\n</p>\n<p>\n  <math display=\"block\">\n    <semantics>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>R</mi>\n        <mo>=</mo>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"italic\">mid</mi>\n        <mo>-</mo>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"italic\">side</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <annotation encoding=\"TeX\">L\\quad =\\quad mid\\quad -\\quad side</annotation>\n    </semantics>\n  </math>\n</p>\n<p>On its own, mid-side stereo coding is lossless, and is commonly used by both lossless and lossy audio codecs. Any loss of detail comes from other steps of the encoding process.</p>\n<h4 id=\"intensity_stereo_coding\">Intensity stereo coding</h4>\n<p><strong>Intensity stereo coding</strong> reduces the encoded audio bit rate by taking advantage of the way humans determine the location of sounds in space; this is called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_localization\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">sound localization</a>. We hear in stereo because our ears detect a sound at different times depending on where the sound is coming from.</p>\n<p>This is because our ears are separated by several inches, thanks to being on opposite sides of our heads. A sound coming from our right will arrive at our right ear before it arrives at our left ear. Our brains determine where the sound is in the space around us by using that time difference to figure out the angle from which the sound is coming. However, as the frequency of the audio signal drops, the wavelength goes up. Eventually, the wavelength approaches then exceeds the distance between the ears, and it becomes difficult or impossible to unambiguously localize the sound.</p>\n<p>Armed with this information, we can approximately represent a stereo audio signal by merging the frequencies that aren't used to determine directionality into a single channel, then include information that indicates the directionality of the sound. This requires fewer bits to represent, but is inherently somewhat lossy.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"see_also","title":"See also","isH3":false,"content":"<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Audio_codecs\">Guide to audio codecs used on the web</a></li>\n</ul>"}}],"toc":[{"text":"Sampling audio","id":"sampling_audio"},{"text":"Audio data format and structure","id":"audio_data_format_and_structure"},{"text":"Audio compression basics","id":"audio_compression_basics"},{"text":"Psychoacoustics 101","id":"psychoacoustics_101"},{"text":"Lossless encoder parameters","id":"lossless_encoder_parameters"},{"text":"Lossy encoder parameters","id":"lossy_encoder_parameters"},{"text":"See also","id":"see_also"}],"summary":"Representing audio in digital form involves a number of steps and processes, with multiple formats available both for the raw audio and the encoded or compressed audio which is actually used on the web.
