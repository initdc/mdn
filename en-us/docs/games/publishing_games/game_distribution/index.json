Mobile devices are where HTML technology can truly shine and show its advantages. There's no Flash, and HTML is fully multiplatform.</p>\n<p>Trying to compete with desktop games directly is very difficult. You can put your HTML games into the same arena (see <a href=\"#native_desktop\">Native desktop</a>, later on) and you should because it's good to diversify the platforms you support, but you have to remember that developers creating desktop games have years of experience, great tools and stable distribution channels. Many HTML games will target different market segments than native desktop games, e.g. simple time killer games to be played while on the move rather than huge immersive experiences. Such games are often designed to be played with two, or even one finger, so you can hold the device, play the game and be able to use the second hand for whatever you currently need.</p>\n<p>Saying this, desktop platforms can be used for distribution quite easily with the availability of wrappers that can help you prepare native builds of your game see <a href=\"#packaging_games\">Packaging games</a>. It's also nice to provide desktop controls for your games even if you're mostly targeting mobile. Players are enjoying your games on any platform available, and desktop is one of them.

An HTML game is just another website.

You can concatenate and minify the code to make it smaller and uglify it so it's a lot harder to reverse engineer your game. Another good measure to take is to provide an online demo if you're planning on packaging it and selling it in a closed store like iTunes or Steam.</p>\n<p>If you're working on a side project just for fun, then leaving the source open will benefit those who would like to learn from what you've created.
