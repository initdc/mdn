You'll be rich and famous, or so they say.</p>\n<p>Many great games get started as a quick, sloppy demo submitted to a competition.

The more information you can include the better — you should include screenshots, description, trailer, press kit, requirements, available platforms, support details and more. You'll get bonus points for allowing your users to directly play your games online — at least in demo form. Also, you should do some work on SEO to allow people to find your games more easily.</p>\n<p>You should also blog about everything related to your gamedev activities. Write about your development process, nasty bugs you encounter, funny stories, lessons learned, and the ups and downs of being a game developer. Continually publishing information about your games will help educate others, increase your reputation in the community, and further improve SEO. A further option is to publish <a href=\"https://end3r.com/blog/?s=monthly+report\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">monthly reports</a> that summarize all your progress — it helps you see what you've accomplished throughout the month and what's still left to do, and it keeps reminding people that your game is coming out soon — building buzz is always good.</p>\n<p>While you can create your website from scratch, there are also tools that can help make the process easier. <a href=\"https://manakeep.com\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">ManaKeep</a> is a website builder made for indie game developers and provides a great starting point to create your website. <a href=\"https://dopresskit.com/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Presskit()</a> is a press kit builder that helps you create a press page to share with the media.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"social_media","title":"Social media","isH3":false,"content":"<p>Your social media presence is very important — follow the right <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/gamedev\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">hashtags</a>, make friends, engage in conversations, help other devs in need. Honesty is key and you should be authentic, because nobody likes boring press releases or pushy advertisements. When the time comes your community will help you spread the word about your shiny little game.</p>\n<p>You should use at least Twitter and Facebook and be active on appropriate forums — the most popular one is <a href=\"https://www.html5gamedevs.com/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">HTML5GameDevs.com</a>. Share your gamedev news and answer questions, so people will value what you're doing and will know that you're OK.

Some portals have their own APIs that allow you to authorize users, save their progress and process in-app purchases. You can also sell a full version of the game from inside your browser demo version, which will be a great move considering high competition, some developers even manage to make full browser versions. Most portals offer revenue share deals or will buy nonexclusive license.</p>\n<p>Free portals offer traffic, but only the best ones are popular enough to generate revenues from advertisements on in-app purchases.

Be sure to check first if they are dealing with specific genres of games or platforms, so you don't send them something that is not relevant to them in the first place.

And you can use your own game as an example, especially in a tutorial when you're <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/Controls_Gamepad_API\">showing how to do something you've implemented already</a>. That way everyone benefits — people learn new skills, your game gets promoted, and if you're lucky you can even get paid for writing a tutorial if it's good enough.</p>\n<p>There are portals like <a href=\"https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Tuts+ Game Development</a> which will be more than happy if you write for them - they pay for the content, but not all topic ideas will be accepted. When writing a tutorial remember to focus on delivering something valuable to the reader. They want to learn something - offer your expertise and use your game as a case study. Focus on one aspect and try to explain it throughout and in detail. Also remember to follow up discussion in comments if people have any questions.</p>\n<p>If portals you contact are not interested in your content because you don't have any experience yet, try writing tutorials and publish them on <a href=\"#website_and_blog\">your own blog</a> first.

The second is earned in time - if you're known enough the YouTubers will contact you and ask for the link or build of your game.

Having a booth gives you the possibility to interact with your fans directly — besides the promotion part you can also test new builds of your game on regular people and fix any bugs (or incorporate any feedback) they uncover.
