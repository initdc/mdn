To add an entity to the scene you have to click on the big plus button located in the top left area of the editor, next to the Hierarchy text. When hovering over that button with your mouse the label will say 'Add Entity' — that's exactly what we want to do. An Entity is any object used in the scene — it can be an object like a box, cylinder or cone, but it can also be a camera, light or sound source. After clicking the button you'll see a dropdown list containing a lot of various entities to choose from. Go ahead and click <em>Box</em> — it will be added to the scene.</p>\n<p>\n  <img src=\"/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/3D_on_the_web/Building_up_a_basic_demo_with_PlayCanvas/editor/playcanvas-editor-newbox.png\" alt=\"PlayCanvas Editor - New box\" width=\"600\" height=\"176\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</p>\n<p>The box is created with the default values — width, height and depth are set to 1, and it is placed in the middle of the scene.

Click on the plus button in the <em>Assets</em> tab, and click on the <em>Material</em> option in the dropdown list that appears to create a new material.</p>\n<p>\n  <img src=\"/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/3D_on_the_web/Building_up_a_basic_demo_with_PlayCanvas/editor/playcanvas-editor-newmaterial.png\" alt=\"PlayCanvas Editor - New material\" width=\"300\" height=\"191\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</p>\n<p>Click on your new material in the assets tab and its entity inspector will appear on the right-hand side of the display.

Click <em>Diffuse</em>, then select the colored box next to the Color label — it will open a <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/Color_wheel\">color wheel</a>. From here you can click your desired color or enter it in the bottom text field as a hex value.
