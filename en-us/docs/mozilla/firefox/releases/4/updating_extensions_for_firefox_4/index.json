While 32x32 pixel icons still work, obviously your add-on will look better if it provides a 64x64 pixel icon instead. Fortunately, 64x64 icons are backward compatible and scale down well, so you can just switch instead of needing both sizes.</p>\n<p>In addition, the back-end of the Add-on Manager was redesigned. The <code>nsIExtensionManager</code> interface is gone, as is the old RDF-based storage it used. Add-on metadata is now stored in an SQLite database, and the Add-on Manager is now a <a href=\"/en-US/docs/JavaScript_code_modules\" class=\"page-not-created\" title=\"This is a link to an unwritten page\">JavaScript code module</a> called <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Addons/Add-on_Manager/AddonManager\" class=\"page-not-created\" title=\"This is a link to an unwritten page\">AddonManager</a>.</p>\n<p>A key difference with the new API is that requesting add-on metadata is now asynchronous instead of synchronous; this applies to add-ons using FUEL as well, so all add-ons that request metadata about add-ons will need to be updated.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"threading","title":"Threading","isH3":false,"content":"<p>You can no longer pass JavaScript objects between threads.

It just places the XPI file in the user profile, and then reads the chrome files and others directly out of the XPI. A jar inside the XPI still works, but is no longer necessary, so that can make your development or build easier. This was done mainly for performance reasons on slow OSes, and allows better cache invalidation, which also helps developers. However, not all kinds of files can be read from within the XPI yet, so if your extension uses one of those, you need to specify <a href=\"/en-US/Install_Manifests#unpack\" class=\"page-not-created\" title=\"This is a link to an unwritten page\"><code>&lt;em:unpack&gt;</code></a> in your install.rdf to cause Firefox to still extract your XPI and use single files, otherwise your extension will fail when trying to access these files.</p>\n<p>If your extension only contains these types of files then you do not need to make any changes:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><code>install.rdf</code></li>\n  <li><code>chrome.manifest</code></li>\n  <li><code>chrome</code> (including <code>content</code>, <code>locale</code>, <code>skin</code>)</li>\n  <li>default preferences</li>\n  <li>XPCOM components written in JavaScript</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your extension contains any of the following then you will need to include <code>&lt;em:unpack&gt;</code> in the install.rdf:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Binary XPCOM components</li>\n  <li>Shared libraries loaded with ctypes</li>\n  <li><code>searchplugins/</code> (which are supposed to be loaded automatically by Firefox)</li>\n  <li><code>dictionaries/</code></li>\n  <li>Window icons (might get <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=595462\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">fixed</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your extension code accesses other files that you have packaged in the XPI then you will either need to include <code>&lt;em:unpack&gt;</code> in the install.rdf or you may be able to support packed installation by making some changes to your code. Any code that used getInstallLocation() and nsIFile will either need em:unpack or needs to be changed. You can use the method <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Addons/Add-on_Manager/Addon#getResourceURI%28%29\" class=\"page-not-created\" title=\"This is a link to an unwritten page\"><code>Addon.getResourceURI()</code></a>, it will return an <code>nsIURI</code> pointing to the requested file. If the extension is unpacked then it will be a <code>file://</code> URI. If the extension is packed then it will be a <code>jar://</code> URI. You can open streams to these URIs by opening a channel using the <code>nsIIOService</code> which will allow you to load the files contents without any unpacking.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"child_hwnds_have_been_removed","title":"Child HWNDs have been removed","isH3":false,"content":"<p>This should only affect a very small number of developers. In previous versions of Firefox, child <code>HWND</code>s were created on Windows for internal use. As a part of the work toward improving graphics performance, these are no longer created.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, a few extensions have been getting access to these <code>HWND</code>s and manipulating them directly; these extensions will no longer work in Firefox 4. We have put a few hacks in place to help certain pointing-device drivers and assistive technology software (screen readers, for example). However, we have decided against adding even more hacks to support extensions, which should never have been doing this in the first place.</p>\n<p>If you maintain an extension that uses native components that rely on <code>HWND</code>s that no longer exist, you'll need to update your extension. There are two ways to do this.</p>\n<p>The first, and better, solution is to stop accessing <code>HWND</code>s and instead use Web features or XUL to implement your extension. There are a lot of new features in Firefox 4 that make possible a lot of things that used to require native code, so you may no longer need to do this.</p>\n<p>If you find that this doesn't work, and you still need to directly access <code>HWND</code>s, you may find that your only solution is to write an <a href=\"/en-US/docs/NPAPI\" class=\"page-not-created\" title=\"This is a link to an unwritten page\">NPAPI</a> plugin that does the work. This may be a lot of work, but it should work.
