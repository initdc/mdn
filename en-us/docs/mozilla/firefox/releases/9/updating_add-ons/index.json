These methods had been deprecated.</li>\n  <li>The <code>nsIEditorSpellCheck.saveDefaultDictionary()</code> method has been removed as part of supporting per-site spell check settings. Also, <code>nsIEditorSpellCheck.updateCurrentDictionary()</code> no longer takes a parameter.</li>\n  <li>The <code>nsIGlobalHistory3</code> interface has been removed.
