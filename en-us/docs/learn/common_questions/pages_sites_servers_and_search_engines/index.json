It has several sections, which is similar to a web server hosting multiple websites.</li>\n  <li>The different sections (science, math, history, etc.) in the library are like websites. Each section is like a unique website (two sections do not contain the same books).</li>\n  <li>The books in each section are like webpages. One website may have several webpages, e.g., the Science section (the website) will have books on heat, sound, thermodynamics, statics, etc. (the webpages). Webpages can each be found at a unique location (URL).</li>\n  <li>The search index is like the search engine. Each book has its own unique location in the library (two books cannot be kept at the same place) which is specified by the catalog number.</li>\n</ul>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"active_learning","title":"Active learning","isH3":false,"content":"<p><em>There is no active learning available yet. <a href=\"/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Contributing/Getting_started\">Please, consider contributing</a>.</em></p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"deeper_dive","title":"Deeper dive","isH3":false,"content":"<p>So, let's dig deeper into how those four terms are related and why they are sometimes confused with each other.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"web_page_2","title":"Web page","isH3":true,"content":"<p>A <strong>web page</strong> is a simple document displayable by a <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/Browser\">browser</a>.

Let's make it clear: A <strong><em>browser</em></strong> is a piece of software that retrieves and displays web pages; a <strong><em>search engine</em></strong> is a website that helps people find web pages from other websites. The confusion arises because, the first time someone launches a browser, the browser displays a search engine's homepage. This makes sense, because, obviously, the first thing you want to do with a browser is to find a web page to display. Don't confuse the infrastructure (e.g., the browser) with the service (e.g., the search engine).
