Very good! But are you sure it works properly?</p>\n<p>A distant web server often behaves quite differently from a local one, so it's a good idea to test your website once it's online. You might be surprised at how many problems come up: images don't show up, pages don't load or load slowly, and so on. Most of the time it's no big deal, just a simple mistake or an issue with your web hosting configuration.</p>\n<p>Let's see how to diagnose and solve those problems.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"active_learning","title":"Active Learning","isH3":false,"content":"<p><em>There is no active learning available yet. <a href=\"/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Contributing/Getting_started\">Please, consider contributing</a>.</em></p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"dig_deeper","title":"Dig deeper","isH3":false,"content":""}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"test_in_your_browser","title":"Test in your browser","isH3":true,"content":"<p>If you want to know whether your website works correctly, the first thing to do is fire up your browser and go to the page you want to test.</p>\n<h4 id=\"uh-oh_wheres_the_image\">Uh-oh, where's the image?</h4>\n<p>Let's look at our personal website, <code>http://demozilla.examplehostingprovider.net/</code>.

Here are the most common statuses:</p>\n<dl>\n  <dt id=\"200_ok\"><strong>200: OK</strong></dt>\n  <dd>\n    <p>The resource you asked for was delivered.</p>\n  </dd>\n  <dt id=\"301_moved_permanently\"><strong>301: Moved permanently</strong></dt>\n  <dd>\n    <p>The resource has moved to a new location. You won't see this much in your browser, but it's good to know about \"301\" since search engines use this information a lot to update their indexes.</p>\n  </dd>\n  <dt id=\"304_not_modified\"><strong>304: Not modified</strong></dt>\n  <dd>\n    <p>The file has not changed since the last time you asked for it, so your browser can display the version from its cache, resulting in faster response times and more efficient use of bandwidth.</p>\n  </dd>\n  <dt id=\"403_forbidden\"><strong>403: Forbidden</strong></dt>\n  <dd>\n    <p>You aren't allowed to display the resource. Usually it has to do with a configuration mistake (e.g. your hosting provider forgot to give you access rights to a directory).</p>\n  </dd>\n  <dt id=\"404_not_found\"><strong>404: Not found</strong></dt>\n  <dd>\n    <p>Self-explanatory. We'll discuss how to solve this below.</p>\n  </dd>\n  <dt id=\"500_internal_server_error\"><strong>500: Internal server error</strong></dt>\n  <dd>\n    <p>Something went wrong on the server. For instance, maybe the server-side language (<a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/PHP\">PHP</a>, .Net, etc.) stopped working, or the web server itself has a configuration problem. Usually it's best to resort to your hosting provider's support team.</p>\n  </dd>\n  <dt id=\"503_service_unavailable\"><strong>503: Service unavailable</strong></dt>\n  <dd>\n    <p>Usually resulting from a short term system overload. The server has some sort of problem. Try again in a little while.</p>\n  </dd>\n</dl>\n<p>As beginners checking our (simple) website, we'll deal most often with 200, 304, 403, and 404.</p>\n<h4 id=\"fixing_the_404\">Fixing the 404</h4>\n<p>So what went wrong?</p>\n<p>\n  <img src=\"/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Checking_that_your_web_site_is_working_properly/demozilla-images-list.png\" alt=\"Le list of images in our project\" width=\"407\" height=\"71\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</p>\n<p>At first glance, the image we asked for seems to be in the right place but the Network tool reported a \"404\".

So correct the typo in your code editor by changing the image's <code>src</code> attribute:</p>\n<p>\n  <img src=\"/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Checking_that_your_web_site_is_working_properly/code-correct.png\" alt=\"Deleting the 's'\" width=\"775\" height=\"125\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</p>\n<p>Save, <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Upload_files_to_a_web_server\">push to the server</a>, and reload the page in your browser:</p>\n<p>\n  <img src=\"/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Checking_that_your_web_site_is_working_properly/image-corrected.png\" alt=\"The image loads correctly in the browser\" width=\"565\" height=\"554\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</p>\n<p>There you go!
