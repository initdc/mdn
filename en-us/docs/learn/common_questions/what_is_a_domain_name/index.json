The most generic TLDs (<code>.com</code>, <code>.org</code>, <code>.net</code>) don't require web services to meet any particular criteria, but some TLDs enforce stricter policies so it is clearer what their purpose is. For example:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Local TLDs such as <code>.us</code>, <code>.fr</code>, or <code>.se</code> can require the service to be provided in a given language or hosted in a certain country — they are supposed to indicate a resource in a particular language or country.</li>\n      <li>TLDs containing <code>.gov</code> are only allowed to be used by government departments.</li>\n      <li>The <code>.edu</code> TLD is only for use by educational and academic institutions.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>TLDs can contain special as well as latin characters. A TLD's maximum length is 63 characters, although most are around 2–3.</p>\n    <p>The full list of TLDs is <a href=\"https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/tlds-2012-02-25-en\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">maintained by ICANN</a>.</p>\n  </dd>\n  <dt id=\"label_or_component\">Label (or component)</dt>\n  <dd>\n    <p>The labels are what follow the TLD. A label is a case-insensitive character sequence anywhere from one to sixty-three characters in length, containing only the letters A through Z, digits 0 through 9, and the - character (which may not be the first or last character in the label). <code>a</code>, <code>97</code>, and <code>hello-strange-person-16-how-are-you</code> are all examples of valid labels.</p>\n    <p>The label located right before the TLD is also called a <em>Secondary Level Domain</em> (SLD).</p>\n    <p>A domain name can have many labels (or components). It is not mandatory nor necessary to have 3 labels to form a domain name. For instance, www.inf.ed.ac.uk is a valid domain name. For any domain you control (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">mozilla.org</a>), you can create \"subdomains\" with different content located at each, like <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org\">developer.mozilla.org</a>, <a href=\"https://iot.mozilla.org/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">iot.mozilla.org</a>, or <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">bugzilla.mozilla.org</a>.</p>\n  </dd>\n</dl>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"buying_a_domain_name","title":"Buying a domain name","isH3":true,"content":"<h4 id=\"who_owns_a_domain_name\">Who owns a domain name?</h4>\n<p>You cannot \"buy a domain name\". This is so that unused domain names eventually become available to use again by someone else. If every domain name was bought, the web would quickly fill up with unused domain names that were locked and couldn't be used by anyone.</p>\n<p>Instead, you pay for the right to use a domain name for one or more years. You can renew your right, and your renewal has priority over other people's applications.

Click on it.</li>\n  <li>Fill out the form with all required details. Make sure especially that you have not misspelled your desired domain name.

Within a few hours, all DNS servers will have received your DNS information.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"notecard note\" id=\"sect2\">\n  <p><strong>Note:</strong> In this process the registrar asks you for your real-world address. Make sure you fill it properly, since in some countries registrars may be forced to close the domain if they cannot provide a valid address.</p>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"dns_refreshing\">DNS refreshing</h4>\n<p>DNS databases are stored on every DNS server worldwide, and all these servers refer to a few special servers called \"authoritative name servers\" or \"top-level DNS servers.\" — these are like the boss servers that manage the system.</p>\n<p>Whenever your registrar creates or updates any information for a given domain, the information must be refreshed in every DNS database. Each DNS server that knows about a given domain stores the information for some time before it is automatically invalidated and then refreshed (the DNS server queries an authoritative server and fetches the updated information from it). Thus, it takes some time for DNS servers that know about this domain name to get the up-to-date information.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"how_does_a_dns_request_work","title":"How does a DNS request work?","isH3":true,"content":"<p>As we already saw, when you want to display a webpage in your browser it's easier to type a domain name than an IP address.
