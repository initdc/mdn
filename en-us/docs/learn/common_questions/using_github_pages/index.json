To do this:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Point the command line to your <code>test-site</code> directory (or whatever you called the directory containing your website). For this, use the <code>cd</code> command (i.e. \"<strong>c</strong>hange <strong>d</strong>irectory\"). Here's what you'd type if you've put your website in a directory called <code>test-site</code> on your desktop:\n    <div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: bash notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token builtin class-name\">cd</span> Desktop/test-site\n</code></pre></div>\n  </li>\n  <li>When the command line is pointing inside your website directory, type the following command, which tells the <code>git</code> tool to turn the directory into a git repository:\n    <div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: bash notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token function\">git</span> init\n</code></pre></div>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"an_aside_on_command_line_interfaces\">An aside on command line interfaces</h4>\n<p>The best way to upload your code to GitHub is via the command line — this is a window where you type in commands to do things like create files and run programs, rather than clicking inside a user interface.
