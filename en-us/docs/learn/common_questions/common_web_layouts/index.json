Contains information relevant to all pages (like site name or logo) and an easy-to-use navigation system.</p>\n  </dd>\n  <dt id=\"main_content\">Main content</dt>\n  <dd>\n    <p>The biggest region, containing content unique to the current page.</p>\n  </dd>\n  <dt id=\"stuff_on_the_side\">Stuff on the side</dt>\n  <dd>\n    <p>1) Information complementing the main content; 2) information shared among a subset of pages; 3) alternative navigation system. In fact, everything not absolutely required by the page's main content.</p>\n  </dd>\n  <dt id=\"footer\">Footer</dt>\n  <dd>\n    <p>Visible at the bottom of every page on the site. Like the header, contains less prominent global information like legal notices or contact info.</p>\n  </dd>\n</dl>\n<p>These elements are quite common in all form factors, but they can be laid out different ways. Here are some examples (<strong>1</strong> represents header, <strong>2</strong> footer; <strong>A</strong> main content; <strong>B1, B2</strong> things on the side):</p>\n<p><strong>1-column layout</strong>. Especially important for mobile browsers so you don't clutter the small screen up.</p>\n<p>\n  <img src=\"/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Common_web_layouts/1-col-layout.png\" alt=\"Example of a 1 column layout: Main on top and asides stacked beneath it.\" width=\"160\" height=\"100\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</p>\n<p><strong>2-column layout</strong>.

You may notice that, while the content can move around on the screen, we always keep the header (1) on top and the footer (2) at the bottom. Also, the main content (A) matters most, so give it most of the space.</p>\n<p>These are rules of thumb you can draw on. There are complex designs and exceptions, of course. In other articles we'll discuss how to design responsive sites (sites that change depending on the screen size) and sites whose layouts vary between pages. For now, it's best to keep your layout consistent throughout your site.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"active_learning","title":"Active learning","isH3":false,"content":"<p><em>There is no active learning available yet. <a href=\"/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Contributing/Getting_started\">Please, consider contributing</a>.</em></p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"deeper_dive","title":"Deeper dive","isH3":false,"content":"<p>Let's study some more concrete examples taken from well-known websites.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"one-column_layout","title":"One-column layout","isH3":true,"content":"<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Invision application</a></strong>.

Especially, the header overlaps the image of the main content. The way the curve of the header's menu ties in with the curve at the bottom of the image, the header and main content look like one thing even though they're technically completely different. The Opera example looks more complex than the MICA example, but it's actually easier to implement (all right, \"easy\" <em>is</em> a relative concept).</p>\n<p>As you see, you can craft stunning websites even with just basic layouts. Have a look at your own favorite websites and ask yourself, where's the header, the footer, the main content, and the side content?
