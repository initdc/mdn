A URL is nothing more than the address of a given unique resource on the Web. In theory, each valid URL points to a unique resource. Such resources can be an HTML page, a CSS document, an image, etc. In practice, there are some exceptions, the most common being a URL pointing to a resource that no longer exists or that has moved.

The <a href=\"https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#absolute-url-string\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">URL standard</a> defines both — though it uses the terms <a href=\"https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#absolute-url-string\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\"><em>absolute URL string</em></a> and <a href=\"https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#relative-url-string\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\"><em>relative URL string</em></a>, to distinguish them from <a href=\"https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">URL objects</a> (which are in-memory representations of URLs).</p>\n<p>Let's examine what the distinction between <em>absolute</em> and <em>relative</em> means in the context of URLs.</p>\n<p>The required parts of a URL depend to a great extent on the context in which the URL is used. In your browser's address bar, a URL doesn't have any context, so you must provide a full (or <em>absolute</em>) URL, like the ones we saw above. You don't need to include the protocol (the browser uses HTTP by default) or the port (which is only required when the targeted Web server is using some unusual port), but all the other parts of the URL are necessary.</p>\n<p>When a URL is used within a document, such as in an HTML page, things are a bit different. Because the browser already has the document's own URL, it can use this information to fill in the missing parts of any URL available inside that document. We can differentiate between an <em>absolute URL</em> and a <em>relative URL</em> by looking only at the <em>path</em> part of the URL. If the path part of the URL starts with the \"<code>/</code>\" character, the browser will fetch that resource from the top root of the server, without reference to the context given by the current document.</p>\n<p>Let's look at some examples to make this clearer.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"examples_of_absolute_urls","title":"Examples of absolute URLs","isH3":true,"content":"<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Full URL (the same as the one we used before)</td>\n      <td>\n        <pre class=\"notranslate\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn</pre>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Implicit protocol</td>\n      <td>\n        <pre class=\"notranslate\">//developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn</pre>\n        <p>\n          In this case, the browser will call that URL with the same protocol as\n          the one used to load the document hosting that URL.\n        </p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Implicit domain name</td>\n      <td>\n        <pre class=\"notranslate\">/en-US/docs/Learn</pre>\n        <p>\n          This is the most common use case for an absolute URL within an HTML\n          document.
