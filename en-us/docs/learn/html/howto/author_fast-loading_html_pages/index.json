Too much time spent querying the last modified time of the referenced files can delay the initial display of the web page, since the browser must check the modification time for each of these files, before rendering the page.</p>\n<p>If you use background images a lot in your CSS, you can reduce the number of HTTP lookups needed by combining the images into one, known as an image sprite. Then you just apply the same image each time you need it for a background and adjust the x/y coordinates appropriately. This technique works best with elements that will have limited dimensions, and will not work for every use of a background image.

It allows for efficient page caching; by means of this header, information is conveyed to the user agent about the file it wants to load, such as when it was last modified. Most web servers automatically append the <code>Last-Modified</code> header to static pages (e.g. <code>.html</code>, <code>.css</code>), based on the last-modified date stored in the file system. With dynamic pages (e.g. <code>.php</code>, <code>.aspx</code>), this, of course, can't be done, and the header is not sent.</p>\n<p>So, in particular, for pages which are generated dynamically, a little research on this subject is beneficial.
