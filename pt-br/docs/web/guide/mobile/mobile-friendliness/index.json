Needless to say, a fixed-width, three-column layout filled with complex JavaScript animations and mouse-over effects is not going to look or feel quite right on a phone with a 2-inch-wide screen and a diminutive processor. A slimmed-down, linearized page layout with elements <a href=\"https://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1085\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">sized for a touchscreen</a> would be much more appropriate.

On the other hand, if many of your site’s users are on devices with less capable browsers, that may eliminate certain strategies as viable options.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"approaches_to_mobile_web_development","title":"Approaches to mobile Web development","isH3":false,"content":"<p>The following approaches aim to achieve each of these goals by different means.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/Web_development/Mobile/Separate_sites\">Separate sites</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/Web_development/Mobile/Responsive_design\">Responsive design</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/Web_development/Mobile/A_hybrid_approach\">A hybrid approach</a></li>\n</ul>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"original_document_information","title":"Original document information","isH3":true,"content":"<p>Originally published on 4 May, 2011 on the Mozilla Webdev blog as \"<a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.com/webdev/2011/05/04/approaches-to-mobile-web-development-part-1-what-is-mobile-friendliness/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Approaches to Mobile Web Development Part 1 - What is Mobile Friendliness?</a>\", by Jason Grlicky.</p>"}}],"toc":[{"text":"O que é site móvel amigável?","id":"o_que_é_site_móvel_amigável"},{"text":"Approaches to mobile Web development","id":"approaches_to_mobile_web_development"}],"summary":"Mobile friendliness can mean a multitude of things, depending on who you’re talking to.
