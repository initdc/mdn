To do this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n <li>Point the command line to your <code>test-site</code> directory (or whatever you called the directory containing your website). For this, use the <code>cd</code> command (i.e. \"<em>c</em>hange <em>d</em>irectory\"). Here's what you'd type if you've put your website in a directory called <code>test-site</code> on your desktop:\n\n  <div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: bash notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token builtin class-name\">cd</span> Desktop/test-site</code></pre></div>\n </li>\n <li>When the command line is pointing inside your website directory, type the following command, which tells the <code>git</code> tool to turn the directory into a git repository:\n  <div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: bash notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token function\">git</span> init</code></pre></div>\n </li>\n</ol>\n\n<h4 id=\"an_aside_on_command_line_interfaces\">An aside on command line interfaces</h4>\n\n<p>The best way to upload your code to Github is via the command line — this is a window where you type in commands to do things like create files and run programs, rather than clicking inside a user interface. It will look something like this:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9483/command-line.png\" style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n\n<div class=\"note notecard\" id=\"sect1\">\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: You could also consider using a <a href=\"http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Git graphical user interface</a> to do the same work, if you feel uncomfortable with the command line.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><span id=\"command-line\">Every operating system comes with a command line tool:</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n <li><strong>Windows</strong>: <strong>Command Prompt</strong> can be accessed by pressing the Windows key, typing <em>Command Prompt</em>, and choosing it from the list that appears. Note that Windows has its own command conventions differing from Linux and OS X, so the commands below may vary on your machine.</li>\n <li><strong>OS X</strong>: <strong>Terminal</strong> can be found in <em>Applications &gt; Utilities</em>.</li>\n <li><strong>Linux</strong>: Usually you can pull up a terminal with <em>Ctrl + Alt + T</em>. If that doesn't work, look for <strong>Terminal </strong>in an app bar or menu.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This may seem a bit scary at first, but don't worry — you'll soon get the hang of the basics. You tell the computer to do something in the terminal by typing in a command and hitting Enter, as seen above.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"creating_a_repo_for_your_code","title":"Creating a repo for your code","isH3":true,"content":"<ol>\n <li>Next, you need to create a new repo for your files to go in.
