These allow streams to be read straight into a buffer supplied by the developer, minimizing the copying required. Which underlying stream (and by extension, reader and controller) your code will use depends on how the stream was created in the first place (see the <a class=\"only-in-en-us\" title=\"Currently only available in English (US)\" href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream/ReadableStream\"><code>ReadableStream.ReadableStream()</code> <small>(en-US)</small></a> constructor page).</p>\n<div class=\"notecard warning\" id=\"sect1\">\n  <p><strong>경고:</strong> <strong>Important</strong>: Byte streams are not implemented anywhere as yet, and questions have been raised as to whether the spec details are in a finished enough state for them to be implemented.
