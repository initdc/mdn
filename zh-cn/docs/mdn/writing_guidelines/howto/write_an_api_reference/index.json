Each <a href=\"#interface_pages\">interface page</a> explains what that interface does and provides a list of the methods and properties that comprise the interface. Then each method and property is documented on its own page, which is created as a subpage of the interface it's a member of. For instance, <a href=\"/zh-CN/docs/Web/API/BaseAudioContext/currentTime\"><code>AudioContext.currentTime</code></a> is documented at <code>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioContext/currentTime</code>.</p>\n<p>For example, given the list above, the <a href=\"/zh-CN/docs/Web/API/AudioContext\"><code>AudioContext</code></a> interface is documented at <code>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioContext</code></p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"create_the_overview_page","title":"Create the overview page","isH3":true,"content":"<p>Now create the overview (API landing) page:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Go to <a href=\"/zh-CN/docs/Web/API\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API</a> and, making sure you are logged in, select the <em>Cog icon &gt; New sub-page</em>.

The menu will look something like the below screenshot.\n    \n    <img src=\"/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Howto/Write_an_api_reference/apiref-links.png\" alt=\"This screenshot shows a vertical navigation menu for the OscillatorNode interface, with multiple sublists for methods and properties, as generated by the APIRef macro \" width=\"302\" height=\"384\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  </li>\n  <li><strong>Standardization status</strong>: The banner indicating the standardization status should be added next to the interface name (these can be placed on the same line as the {{APIRef}} macro):\n    <ul>\n      <li>{{SeeCompatTable}} for an experimental feature (i.e. the spec is not at the CR level.)</li>\n      <li>{{Deprecated_header}}</li>\n      <li>{{Non-standard_header}}</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><strong>Description</strong>: the first paragraph of the property page should provide a short, concise description of the property's overarching purpose. You may also want to include a couple more paragraphs if any additional description is required. Obvious extra information to include is its default/initial value, and whether it's read only or not. The structure of the first sentence must be:\n    <dl>\n      <dt id=\"for_read-only_properties\">For read-only properties</dt>\n      <dd>\n        <p>The <strong><code>InterfaceName.property</code></strong> read-only property returns a {{domxref(\"type\")}} that...</p>\n      </dd>\n      <dt id=\"for_other_properties\">For other properties</dt>\n      <dd>\n        <p>The <strong><code>InterfaceName.property</code></strong> property is a {{domxref(\"type\")}} that…</p>\n      </dd>\n    </dl>\n    <div class=\"notecard note\" id=\"sect8\">\n      <p><strong>备注：</strong> <code>InterfaceName.property</code> should be in <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>, and should additionally be in bold (<code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>) the first time it's used.</p>\n    </div>\n  </li>\n  <li><strong>Syntax</strong>: The syntax section should show how to get the property, and how to set it, if it's not read only. Use the <code>syntaxbox</code> class for it and italics for part to be replaced by the actual variable name. For example:\n    <div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: js notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">var</span> myType <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> oscillator<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>type<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\noscillator<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>type <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> aType<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre></div>The syntax section should also have a subsection — \"Value\", which will contain a description of the property's value. This should contain the data type of the property, and what it represents. For an example, see <a class=\"only-in-en-us\" title=\"Currently only available in English (US)\" href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition/grammars\"><code>SpeechRecognition.grammars</code> <small>(en-US)</small></a>\n  </li>\n  <li><strong>Example</strong>: Include a code listing to show typical usage of the property in question. You should start with a simple example that shows how an object of the type is created and how to access the property. More complex examples can be added after such an example. In these additional examples, rather than listing ALL the code, you should list an interesting subset of it. For a complete code listing, you can reference a <a href=\"https://github.com/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Github</a> repo containing the full example, and you could also link to a live example created using the <a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">github gh-pages feature</a> (so long as it uses only client-side code of course.)
